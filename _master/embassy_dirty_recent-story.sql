As one of the co-chairs of the Canada-Japan Interparliamentary Committee, I met with my parliamentary counterparts a few weeks ago to discuss mutual issues of concern and co-operation.\r\n\r\nJapan has been enjoying its longest period of sustained economic growth in the post-Second World War period, but Canada has been under-achieving relative to its trade competitors. Now is the time to regain the initiative and take advantage of the world''s second largest economy (which will remain so into at least the next decade.)\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that it continues to generate record reserves&mdash;$1 trillion (U.S.)&mdash;and is the biggest net creditor, Canadians need to pay closer attention to a country that many have either ignored or taken for granted since the rise of China in the past two decades. Although our relationship with China is important, we must also recognize that Japan must remain a significant partner for Canada.\r\n\r\nJapan represents a significant market for many Canadian exporters, but the Japanese market is also a world-leader in automotive, advanced manufacturing and electronic goods. The need for minerals, energy, and agri-food sectors helps Canada''s efforts to gain Japanese attention as a secure and dependable supplier. My recent meetings with Japanese officials underscored the desire for Canada as a valuable partner, with energy resources as an example.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Japan was Canada''s sixth ranked source of foreign direct investment (FDI), with stock value at $11.3 billion (2.2 per cent of Japan''s global total) through more than 550 Japanese subsidiaries and affiliate companies employing tens of thousands of Canadians. Canadian direct investment in Japan stood at $4.9 billion, or 94 per cent of our worldwide Canadian direct investment abroad (CDIA) total.*\r\n\r\nIn 2007, two-way trade in goods totalled $24.6 billion, of which Canadian exports totalled $9.2 billion (down 2.8 per cent from 2006), making Japan Canada''s fourth largest merchandise market.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Canadian exports of services to Japan reached $1.4 billion.  When trade in goods and services ($26.8 billion in 2007) is combined with CDIA and FDI flows, Japan is by far our largest commercial market in the world''s fastest growing region.*\r\n\r\nAs hubs for various global companies, Tokyo and Osaka are important entry points to a global business environment, and especially as an entry point for markets in China and South Korea. Given this factor, there has been little media attention about this relationship, as the focus has been on China and India. Yet Japan, a country of 120 million people, has an economy that is greater than all of Asia combined.\r\n\r\nWe need to take advantage of the opportunities in Japan and not be complacent by treating it as less important than other countries. Both countries have taken their relationship for granted and indeed the relationship has been neglected in recent years.\r\n\r\nCertainly the decision to close our consulates in Osaka and Fukaoka in 2007 were viewed by the Japanese in a very negative light. If we continue to allow our market share to decrease, then countries such as the United States and Australia will fill the void. \r\n\r\nOn a positive note, the Liberal government in November 2005, together with the Japanese, launched the Canada-Japan Economic Framework, consisting of fifteen priority areas of co-operation: trade facilitation; customs; investment; science and technology; information and communication technology; tax convention; transportation; e-commerce; anti-competitive activities; tourism promotion; social security; food safety; e-government; energy and natural resources; and climate change.\r\n\r\nA key outcome of the framework was a joint study on the costs and benefits of further promoting and liberalizing bilateral trade and investment.  In October 2007, the <i>Report of the Canada-Japan Joint Study on Benefits and Costs of Further Promotion of Bilateral Trade and Investment</i> was published.\r\n\r\nThis report concluded "that a Canada-Japan [free trade agreement] could yield economic benefits for both countries as a whole."  As a result, the two countries have decided to revisit the possibility of an FTA.  Japan in particular is watching the current Canadian discussions with the Republic of Korea on a FTA, and if one is concluded, it would be an impetus for Japan to move forward with Canada on an agreement.\r\n\r\nThe report also commented favourably on the usefulness of initiating a bilateral dialogue on regulatory reform to address regulatory barriers, seen as key impediments to bilateral commerce; investment promotion and co-operation; and updating the double taxation agreement between the two countries.  It is essential that these issues be addressed in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nIn my recent meetings in Tokyo, I pushed for a strengthening of the relationship both in terms of trade and investment, and in areas of increased co-operation of peacekeeping.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatives'' approach to Japan, as it is to Asia in general, has been a failure to understand the importance of the region and the need to promote and cultivate relationships. A strategic approach to trade, diplomacy and investment is critical if we are to compete and demonstrate that Canada does matter to Asia and in particular to Japan.\r\n\r\nAs I indicated earlier, this is the 80<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two countries, and we must take the opportunity to move this important relationship to a new level. There is no question that Canada''s national interests will be damaged if we do not develop a more aggressive and co-ordinated approach to the Japanese market.  \r\n\r\n<i>Bryon Wilfert is the co-chair of the Canada-Japan Interparliamentary Committee and the Official Opposition defence critic.

Unfortunately, the majority of Canadians had no clue what this organization was and could care less about the cancellation. This was despite the fact that most journalists that have visited Afghanistan in the past four years, myself included, have written feature stories about the SAT.\n\nIn brief, this was a team of Canadian officers established to mentor the government of Hamid Karzai and "build capacity" within the fledgling democratic administration.\n\nThe bilateral arrangement was drafted between none other than Karzai and former chief of defence staff Rick Hillier in 2004. The normal tour of duty for SAT members was a full year and although they were all serving military personnel, in the course of their duties, they wore civilian clothes.\n\nIn principle, Canadian officers with a specific area of expertise would be assigned to the appropriate ministry. For instance, a legal officer would work with the Afghan justice department or a finance officer with the revenue department.\n\nAlthough administratively SAT was supported by the Canadian Expeditionary Force Command, they were a completely separate entity from the battle group in Kandahar. In fact, they answered more or less only to Hillier himself.\n\nNeedless to say, certain cheerleading Canadian journalists that had reported on SAT touted this team as something just short of the second coming of Christ: Miracle workers one and all. Upon learning that the team was to be discontinued, the usual Colonel Blimps kicked awake these military establishment media guard dogs and sent them barking madly into the fray.\n\nJealousy on the part of the Foreign Affairs department was the oft-cited culprit of the Harper government pulling the plug on this incredible military venture. The barking dogs argued that the very success of SAT had doomed it to destruction by the envious, cowering, incompetent bureaucrats at Foreign Affairs who could no longer stand seeing the laurels heaped upon their military counterparts.\n\nWhat everyone failed to realize in the heat of the moment was that SAT was never meant to be a permanent fixture attached to the Afghan government. In those first early days of the Karzai regime, there certainly was a vacuum of expertise that needed to be filled. Like a paramedic arriving on the scene to find a patient near death, SAT was meant to monitor the vital signs until more qualified assistance could be administered.\n\nNo one expected SAT to fully rehabilitate the Afghan government. As competent as they may be within their trades in the Canadian Forces, the SAT members could not have possibly been expected to effectively mentor Afghan ministers in the management of entire government departments&mdash;especially since the Canadians assigned did not speak either Dari or Pashtu and their lifelong experience has been in a G8 nation in the Western Hemisphere. Even well experienced senior bureaucrats from Canada would have a difficult job trying to adapt their administrative skills to coach their counterparts in an impoverished, wartorn, Islamic, central Asian nation.\n\nAt the time that SAT was established, many other NATO members questioned why Canada alone would send our military, in particular, to take on such a challenging role. Since then, other nations have taken on specific re-building projects within the Afghan administration.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that the Karzai government&mdash;even with all its foreign mentoring&mdash;is one of the most impotent, corrupt and hated regimes on the planet. No matter how much some of my colleagues wish to bay at the moon in defence of SAT, the Afghan government''s woeful track record is the strategic advisory team''s legacy. \n\nWhile I will deal with Foreign Affairs ineptitude in Afghanistan in a separate column, I hardly think that they were jealous of SAT''s success, given that their efforts were in fact a dismal failure.\n\n<i>Scott Taylor is editor and publisher of </i>Esprit de Corps<i> magazine.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 32, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'inside_defence-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5962, '<b> How Canada Can Save Its Endangered Seal Hunt </b>  \n', 'The Canadian government has pledged to oppose last month''s proposal by the European Union to ban the trade in products from seals that have been inhumanely killed.', 'The Canadian government has pledged to oppose last month''s proposal by the European Union to ban the trade in products from seals that have been inhumanely killed. But the EU, under pressure from aroused publics stirred by animal welfare groups and gruesome images of the hunt, is not likely to back away from its plan.\n\nA Canada-EU accord setting out agreed killing and compliance standards offers both sides a better way to put their seal trade on a more durable basis.\n\nThe core elements of a humane sealing pact are not difficult to identify. Although the EU does not say what it considers to be a humane hunt, it refers approvingly to a December 2007 report of the European Food Safety Authority, which affirms that seals can be "killed rapidly and effectively, without causing avoidable pain, distress, fear and other forms of suffering, using a variety of methods."\n\nThe report identifies a "three-step" process, consisting of clubbing or shooting, ensuring the seal is dead, and bleeding and skinning, that conforms to existing Canadian standards.\n\nTo help ensure that hunting practices are consistent with those standards, Canada could agree to begin a mandatory training scheme for sealers. Existing monitoring methods could be augmented by the introduction of a jointly appointed official observer team similar to one Canada put in place in the 1960s.  Composed of veterinarians and other experts, it could be empowered to observe, report and make recommendations concerning the hunt.\n\nA precedent for such an agreement exists in the recently approved Canadian-EU-Russian Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards for the wild fur industry that replaces leghold traps with certified traps that meet humane standards. The pact has all but stilled protests over trapping. The EU has not ruled out similar accords for the seal trade.\n\nThis would not likely satisfy protest groups who want commercial sealing abolished. But in formally committing themselves to an understanding of what constitutes a humane hunt, Canada and the EU would, for the first time, become allies in confronting protests to which the Union has frequently yielded in the past. An agreement would also remove a persistent irritant from the bilateral agenda.\n\nThe Canadian government and the sealing industry worked hard to build a hunt for more mature seals after the EU imposed a permanent import ban on seal pup products in 1989, in response to public pressure campaigns driven by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and other groups.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, improved sales and a dramatic increase in the seal population resulted in a major expansion of the hunt.  In 2003, Ottawa unwisely raised the quota to 975,000 over the next three years, an increase of 150,000 over the previous three-year total. The new quota posed no threat to the robust seal population, but it was close enough to one million to give anti-sealing groups a new basis on which to oppose the hunt.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States, a newcomer to the debate, took the lead, launching a boycott of Canadian fish products in that country. Although the campaign garnered considerable publicity, it had no effect on fish sales and the market for seal pelts remained strong.\n\nIt was clear that Europe would again become the main battleground over the hunt. Premier Danny Williams unwittingly helped to set the stage during his celebrated appearance on the Larry King show in early 2006 with anti-sealing campaigners Paul McCartney and ex-wife Heather Mills, when he appeared to link IFAW to FBI terrorist investigations. His comments, which brought a threat of legal action from IFAW, propelled the group back to the forefront of the protests.\n\nIt re-emerged a key player in mobilizing Europeans against the hunt. By September 2006, 425 of the 785 members of the European Parliament had signed a declaration calling for a trade ban on seal products, and Belgium and the Netherlands were on their way to closing their markets. The EU Commission ruled out a ban on conservation grounds, but it agreed to study the issue of humaneness and to propose new restrictions if required.  Last month''s proposal was the result.\n\nUncertainty over access to the EU market would not be a death blow to the sealing industry. However, Europe remains an important destination for seal products and a major transit point for shipments to Norway, Russia and China. Canada should formalize its seal trade relationship with the EU while it has the opportunity to do so. \n\n<i>Donald Barry is a professor of political science at the University of Calgary.

Polish people recall this with gratitude.\n\nWhen our country languished under communism, Canadians demonstrated their support for the Solidarity free trade union movement by taking part in marches on Parliament Hill and deluging their MPs with countless petitions in protest against the imposition in 1981 of martial law.\n\nLater, the Canadian government closely observed the Round Table talks and, in November 1989, warmly welcomed in Canada the leader of Solidarno, Lech Wa&#322;sa.\n\nCulminating the struggle for Poland to live freely and securely in the family of Western nations, our accession to NATO in 1999 had also been facilitated in no small part by Canada''s efforts. Many of our officers learned NATO standards, including English language proficiency, in Canadian schools. Ultimately, Canada became the first NATO country to ratify our accession to the Alliance.\n\nIt was a long journey for the Polish nation, which was terribly tested by 20<sup>th</sup>-century history. Our experiences, however, have led us to place a premium on the promotion of democracy, especially close to home&mdash;in Eastern Europe.\n\nSince the 1990s it has been a consistent Polish policy to promote democracy based on our conviction that more democracy&mdash;a flourishing of democratic norms and values&mdash;means more stability and security for all.\n\nPoland''s assistance to countries struggling with democratization would not have been successful were it not for a joint co-operation with mature Western democracies. Here again, Canada must be singled out.\n\nOne of the addressees of Polish and Canadian democratization assistance has been Ukraine. Canada, with 1.2 million people of Ukrainian descent, and Poland, with a small Ukrainian minority of its own and living next-door to Ukraine, have been doing much to help anchor Ukraine in a democratic community of nations. \n\nWe lent Ukraine a hand at its rebirth. In December 1991, Poland and Canada became the first countries to recognize sovereign Ukraine. Zbigniew Brzeziski, former national security adviser to U.S. president Jimmy Carter, then stated an obvious imperative: "The time has come for...the world to recognize that a free and democratic Ukraine is as essential to a stable Europe as a free and democratic Russia or as free and democratic Baltic states."\n\nWhen, in 2004, Kiev became the focal point of the Orange Revolution, Poland and Canada stood at the forefront in mobilizing international support for democracy. Our countries sent the largest numbers of independent observers to monitor an election run-off. Among 12,400 international observers were more than 1,000 Poles and nearly 1,000 Canadians, many of them of Ukrainian background.\n\nLech Wa&#322;sa and then-president Aleksander Kwaniewski went to Kiev to help mediate a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Canadian parliamentarians, including Borys Wrzesnewskij, who ran an online petition entitled Yushchenko: The Will of the People, and Peter Goldring, also encouraged Ukrainians in Kiev.\n\nPoles and Canadians saw a need to help Ukrainians make a radical break with abuse of power, election fraud, lack of transparency and manipulation. Poles, in particular, imbued with the values of Solidarity, felt that Ukraine represented a test-case of democratic ideals.\n\nStudents from the University of Warsaw and as far as the University of Alberta wore orange scarves while some went to Kiev to spend sleepless nights on the Majdan central square in solidarity with their Ukrainian colleagues. \n\nDeveloping democratic standards and civil society have long been a focus of Polish-Canadian co-operation in delivering assistance to democratizing states. In 2006 we launched the Polish-Canadian Development Co-operation Program, which engaged in implementing projects in transition states, including Ukraine. Co-financed together by the Polish Foreign Ministry and CIDA, the projects aimed at providing leadership training, building local partnerships, strengthening schools and community networks, lending assistance to local authorities, building knowledge-based society, as well as strengthening transparency and ethics in government.\n\nLet me add that our means of delivering assistance to Ukraine had been enhanced thanks to Canada''s Official Development Assistance in Central Europe (ODACE) program, from which Poland benefited from 2002 to 2007. From a recipient of aid and counsel, Poland has now become a donor. Yet another milestone has been reached.\n\nSince Ukraine''s assumption of sovereign statehood, it has been Polish policy to help Ukraine integrate with a democratic community, including international security organizations.\n\nIn 1995, Kiev and Warsaw established a joint Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Battalion. The idea behind this project was to assist Ukraine in its co-operation with Euro-Atlantic security structure and to highlight Ukraine''s role as a viable contributor to European security. Not surprisingly, in light of our shared objectives, the unit received support from Canada, which financed English courses for the troops and provided the battalion with computer equipment. \n\nToday, both Poland and Canada support Ukraine in its bid to join NATO. The rationale behind our efforts was expressed succinctly by Prime Minister Stephen Harper during the visit of Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko to Canada in May 2008. The Canadian prime minister said: "This is, we understand, part of your design to see Ukraine embrace the transatlantic community and our shared democratic and free market values. Ukraine has always demonstrated its commitment to our NATO allies.... In fact, Ukraine is the only non-NATO country supporting every NATO mission in some way or other."\n\nA part of democratic maturation involves acknowledging painful chapters in one''s history for the sake of reconciliation. In Ukraine, such a troubled past is exemplified by Holodomor, also known as Great Famine, which was the decimation of millions of Ukrainians in 1932-33 under the Stalinist regime.\n\nThe Polish parliament in 2006, and Canadian parliamentarians last May, agreed the Great Famine of 1932-1933 was genocide against the Ukrainian nation. Poland and Canada are thus two of 26 countries to have recognized Holodomor.\n\nAlthough I can only speak for Poland, I believe we share a sentiment that instilling a democratic value of integrity in public life cannot proceed if historical memory becomes confined to a "grey zone" where one cannot speak the truth.\n\nPoland and Canada also see the pivotal place of Ukraine in an evolving Eurasian system of energy security. Ukraine possesses a dense network of oil and natural gas transportation routes. It is in the interest of the Euro-Atlantic community to ensure a secure, integrated supply of energy.\n\nPoland, for this reason, has spearheaded an adoption of energy security agenda in NATO and the European Union. A Secure, transparent and predictable energy market in Europe would be concomitantly beneficial to a global energy market in which Canada plays an increasingly significant role. \n\nAssisting fellow citizens of the world in establishing democratic structures and strengthening civil society remains a noble cause. However, we should be mindful that democracy has to adapt to specific conditions in each country and the value of democratic institutions has to be learned in practice.\n\nIn many states, the way to democracy can be long and arduous, but it does not mean that it is not worth embarking upon. This is the case with Afghanistan, where Poland and Canada, together with other NATO allies, including Ukraine, help to create a stable, democratic state.\n\nWe have already been making a difference in the lives of Afghan women and children. Though the reality will not change overnight, ultimately it is through our perseverance in pursuing successive steps&mdash;whether big or small&mdash;that we will effect a lasting change.\n\n<i>Ryszard Schnepf is deputy foreign minister of the Republic of Poland.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'schnepf-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5964, '<b> Austria: Respected Partners in an Evolving World </b>  \n', 'If you ask Europeans, no matter if Austrians, Italians or Danes, about Canada, you will most certainly get an impressive list of positive things Canada is associated with: stable democracy, high living standards, gorgeous nature, friendly population and so forth.', 'If you ask Europeans, no matter if Austrians, Italians or Danes, about Canada, you will most certainly get an impressive list of positive things Canada is associated with: stable democracy, high living standards, gorgeous nature, friendly population and so forth.\n\nNo doubt Canada is very popular among Europeans and is in many ways perceived and admired as an exemplary society. \n\nEuropeans traditionally consider Canada a like-minded country. There is a clear sense that Europe and Canada, due to history and close cultural ties, have many values in common: a focus on human rights and the rule of law, or a strong commitment to an efficient multilateral system. \n\nIn all these areas, Canada has an outstanding international record which reflects her pro-active and forthcoming attitude. Looking back, particularly Austria has always shared with Canada a special commitment to the work of the United Nations, as a provider of troops for peacekeeping operations and with other contributions to peace and security worldwide.\n\nAustria particularly values her co-operation with Canada in the humanitarian field, be it Canada''s leading role in the so-called Ottawa Process on the Ban of Anti-Personnel Mines or joining the Oslo process on banning cluster munitions, of which Austria was a driving force from the very beginning. \n\nIn a nutshell: Europe and Canada are natural partners. Of course, we are talking about a living and evolving partnership. \n\nThe EU has grown far beyond the economic organization of nine members at the time when the relationship with Canada was first formalized in 1976.\n\nThe EU, the world''s biggest trading block, is now a union of 27 member states, with a population of nearly half a billion people. It has reunited a fractured continent and successfully worked to bring peace and prosperity to its citizens. A barrier-free single market as well as a single currency in the Euro-zone and passport-free travel in the Schengen area bear testimony to how far the integration of our continent has come. \n\nAnd the EU is still developing and growing. The EU is an attractive organization to its neighbourhood. The incentive of joining the EU has an immense transformational capacity. Countries eager to join willingly adopt&mdash;at times painful&mdash;reforms to reach European standards.\n\nThe re-unification of the European continent will only be completed once the whole of Southeast Europe&mdash;the Balkans&mdash;are part of the union. This is the European peace project of my generation.\n\nGlobal and regional challenges and concerns have very much changed since the early days of EU-Canada relations. Yet the EU and Canada can still make a difference in jointly tackling these challenges.\n\nNeither can anybody deny that the EU and Canada have made considerable headway in their bilateral relations. They closely co-operate on a wide range of global and regional challenges. Bilateral trade is constantly growing. Over the past six years, Canadian exports to the EU amounted to some $150 billion. The EU is Canada''s second largest commercial partner after the U.S. Some 30 per cent of foreign direct investment in Canada originates from Europe.\n\nYet more is still possible, and I sense a clear political commitment on both sides to take this partnership even further. For that purpose, the EU and Canada agreed in 2007 to jointly draw up a study to examine and assess the costs and benefits of a closer economic partnership. The upcoming Canada-EU summit in October this year in Montreal will be an opportunity to set the stage for advancing the bilateral agenda. \n\nI am proud that Austria is actively contributing to the EU''s flourishing trade and investment relationship with Canada. In fact, trade and investment flows between Austria and Canada are considerable, with an annual trade volume of some $2 billion. \n\nIt may be surprising to many, but a number of top world brands widely known to Canadians come from Austria. The Austrian energy drink giant Red Bull has the biggest market share in its segment in Canada. Swarovski, renowned worldwide for their crystals, set up a whole network of stores in Canada. \n\n The Olympic Winter Games 2010 in Vancouver will partly rely on infrastructure from Austria. In Whistler, the Austrian company Doppelmayr constructed a stationary peak-to-peak gondola, which transports 2,000 people per hour each way. Another example is Austrian construction company Strabag, which will build a 10.4 km hydro tunnel under the Niagara Falls. In total, some 100 subsidiaries of Austrian companies are successfully doing business in Canada.\n\n Austria is an attractive market for Canadian companies, too. Many of them also capitalize on Austria''s role as a hub for their business relationships with Central and Eastern Europe, or even beyond. The most prominent Canadian investors are Bombardier and Magna. Every BMW X3 on the streets in Canada is manufactured in Magna factories in Austria. \n\nNaturally, there are issues where the EU and Canada take differing views or have different priorities. But there is so much more binding us together and comparatively minor issues where we differ. The overall picture and the resolve on both sides to go ahead make me confident that the EU-Canada strategic partnership is on a good track. \n\n<i>Ursula Plassnik is Austria''s minister of European and international affairs.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'plassnik-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5965, '<b> A Guide to Navigating the EU Labyrinth </b>  \n', 'Brussels is not your typical centre of power.', 'Brussels is not your typical centre of power.

Essentially the bloc''s civil service writ large, with 27 specialized departments dealing with matters such as justice and industrial regulation. The number of departments is no coincidence&mdash;each being headed by a nationally-appointed commissioner.  \n\n<b>The European Parliament</b>:  The EU''s only directly-elected body, made up of 785 members of parliament sitting in seven Europe-wide groups that represent the bloc''s entire political spectrum. Primarily based in Brussels, but also holds a monthly plenary session in the French town of Strasbourg.  \n\n<b>The Council of Ministers (also known as the Council of the European Union)</b>: Main EU decision-making body representing ministers from the 27 member states organized according to dossiers. Shares decision-making powers with Parliament on economic, social and environmental policies, although tends to wield superior influence. Has sole right of decision on foreign, defence and security policies. \n\n<i>&mdash;Lorraine Mallinder </i></div>The EU quarter of Brussels, home to the bloc''s three main institutions&mdash;the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers&mdash;now attracts movers and shakers from around the world. Here, under grey skies, lobbyists, consultants, lawyers, campaigners, journalists, national diplomats and EU officials mingle in discrete bars and restaurants, discussing legislation that now makes up around three-quarters of the body of law in the union''s 27 member states. \n\nIncreasingly, the stealthy influence of the Brussels machine extends beyond Europe''s borders, as foreign companies are finding out&mdash;sometimes to their cost. The Commission''s antitrust department&mdash;the executive''s most powerful arm, which functions as a stand-alone agency&mdash;crossed swords with U.S. information technology giant Microsoft back in 2004, levying a fine of 497 million euros ($750 million) for anti-competitive conduct. Microsoft''s attempts to appeal the ruling in the European courts failed last year. The Commission responded with more fines and further investigations. Microsoft''s humiliation was complete. \n\nThe Microsoft case confirmed the Commission''s clout as an arbiter of antitrust issues rivalling the U.S. Department of Justice and the Japanese Fair Trade Institute.  But, the onward march of the Brussels machine does not stop there. In other policy areas, too, the EU is increasing its influence, attempting to carve out a new role for itself as a regulatory beacon for emerging markets such as China and India.\n\nAmbitious new standards, such as chemicals safety law REACH (the regulation on registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals) typify the EU''s soft approach to empire building. REACH, the most stringent chemicals legislation in the world, is a gold standard of sorts for the sector and a regulatory blueprint for emerging economies. Any chemicals firm with global ambitions cannot afford to ignore its existence.\n\nREACH sparked the biggest, fiercest and most expensive lobbying battles ever witnessed in Brussels. The corporate campaign to weaken the standards, strongly supported by the U.S. administration, included big hitters from outside the EU, such as the U.S.-based Dow Chemical Company. \n\nThe battle had some bitter outcomes, with Greenpeace alleging that industry had bankrolled support from industry-affiliated lawmakers. Furthermore, the NGO said, officials from the chemicals sector had been planted in the Commission to steer proposals in industry''s direction. The complaints are now being investigated by the EU ombudsman.\n\nPerhaps the hottest issue currently making its way through the EU legislative pipeline is the so-called climate and energy package, a bundle of laws aiming, inter alia, to reduce the EU''s overall carbon emissions by at least 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. Lawmakers are keen to broker agreement on the package by the end of this year, amid growing internal divisions over how the burden of compliance should be shared out between richer and poorer member states and how energy-intensive industries should be catered for. \n\nThe climate and energy package is the EU''s biggest regulatory wager so far. Brussels wants to lead the rest of the world by example at next year''s United Nations climate change talks in Copenhagen, placing its economic competitiveness on the line in a bid to secure a seat on the moral high ground. EU industries with strong domestic output, such as the steel, paper, chemicals and cement industries, are quaking at the prospect of targets that could place them at a severe disadvantage compared to foreign rivals and are already lobbying for defensive trade measures.\n\nIt is the most fervent wish of Brussels eurocrats, however, that the rest of the world will end up following their lead, hence establishing the EU as a global leader on the crucial issues of the day. All regulatory roads, they believe, will then lead to Brussels. \n\n\n<b>Lobbying in Brussels</b>\n\nBrussels plays host to an estimated 15,000 lobbyists from a variety of sources, including companies, multi-client consultancies, law firms, NGOs, civil society groups and trade unions. \n\nMuch like anywhere else, the influence wielded by these players hinges on knowledge of the legislative process, inside contacts, media awareness, resources and persistence. Unlike anywhere else, the intricate, supranational and, above all, obscure nature of the Brussels machine is such that it is not always clear who is influencing what...and how. \n\nOn a basic level, the EU legislative process is perfectly straightforward and transparent. All EU laws are conceived in the European Commission''s star-shaped mothership, known as the Berlaymont. Generally, the process kicks off with a green paper announcing legislative intentions, followed by a public consultation with interested parties.\n\nGetting involved at this stage, either through an in-house representative or one of the many consultancies dotted around the city, is a must for anyone with serious stakes. Specialized players with niche knowledge may often find their expertise sought out by the Commission. The pushy will demand an audience with officials.\n\nOutcomes from the consultation are generally channelled into a white paper, which sketches out defined policy options. Any resulting legislative proposals, in particular on economic, social and environmental policy, will then be examined and amended by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, a procedure known in EU lingo as co-decision. (Decisions on foreign policy, security, police and judicial matters are taken primarily by member states.) \n\nThe passage of proposals through Parliament is typically very open. Members of Parliament (MEPs) select what is known as a rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs from different political groupings to scrutinize amendments and find viable compromises likely to garner sufficient political support. The rapporteurs generally welcome one-to-one meetings with interested parties and public hearings are held before amendments are tabled and voted by MEPs on the lead parliamentary committee. \n\nAt this point, the Council will have creaked into action, assessing the various positions of the 27 member states. Generally, this stage of proceedings is closed to players who cannot find a crucial entry point through national diplomats. \n\nNegotiations among member states, which take place behind closed doors, will frequently involve a fair amount of "horse-trading" (on matters which are not necessarily related to the legislation under discussion). Council will attempt to form a common position among member states before going on to negotiate a political agreement with the Parliament, which may change proposals further. It is important to note, in this last stage, that the political affiliation and national interests of Parliament''s lead rapporteur may have a bearing on the final compromise.\n\nIn cases where there is no political agreement in first reading, proposals may be subject to a second reading. Doomed proposals that fail to get through second reading are picked apart in a last-ditch salvage procedure known as conciliation. It is increasingly rare for proposals to reach this stage.\n\n\n<b>Lobbyists Under Fire</b>\n\nIn the labyrinthine world of EU policymaking, with its multi-dimensional national affiliations and vested interests, a little technical advice in the right ears is capable of going a long way without ever being detected.\n\nTwo years ago, the Commission''s anti-fraud chief Siim Kallas announced his intention to open the "Brussels black box". One of the results of his drive is a newly-introduced lobbyists register aiming to shine more light into the nooks and crannies of the Brussels machine.  \n\nThe register has been criticized, however, for lacking teeth. For a start, it works on a voluntary basis. And although professional lobbyists must declare to the nearest 50,000 ($80,000) how much they spend on campaigns, they do not have to identify clients.\n\nOn public-private transfers, or the "revolving doors" phenomenon, the EU is also relatively relaxed.  There are no mandatory "cooling-off" periods for officials spilling out of EU institutions into the private sector. \n\nBy way of comparison, Canada''s revised lobbying act, which came into effect last month, sets a cooling-off period of five years for Cabinet ministers, ministerial staffers, and senior public servants. Ex officials can, however, duck the requirements if their lobbying activities constitute less than 20 per cent of their workload. They are also allowed to provide services in an advisory capacity.\n\n<i>Lorraine Mallinder is a freelance journalist with extensive experience of reporting on EU politics and business. She has been associated with Brussels-based </i>European Voice<i>, an Economist Group weekly, for the past four years.</i>\n\n<i>lorrainemallinder@yahoo.co.uk</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'mallinder-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5966, '<b> Fitting Into France''s EU Presidential Priorities </b>  \n', 'Canada and the European Union share many essential values in terms of developing political and economic relations.', 'Canada and the European Union share many essential values in terms of developing political and economic relations.\n\nEurope, more specifically France, will never forget the Canadians who shed their blood in Europe during the world wars. This brotherhood under arms, which can be seen today in our mutual military commitment in Afghanistan, is based on shared values. Given these shared values, it is no coincidence that the Canadian professor, John Humphrey, was one of the main writers of the 60-year-old Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nIn addition, economic exchanges between the EU and Canada are in a constant state of development. The EU has become Canada''s second-largest economic partner with $110 billion in goods and services and $262 billion in direct investments.\n\nThis year, 2008, is full of events that play a pivotal role in developing EU-Canada relations. For example, there is the EU-Canada Summit, which will be co-chaired by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the President of the European Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, on Oct. 17 in Montreal. This summit has several objectives, some of them related to the priorities of the French Presidency of the European Union.\n\nAn economic component of this summit should reinforce economic relations between the EU and Canada, thereby enabling Canadian companies to access a foreseeable and stable market consisting of nearly 500 million consumers.\n\nThis reinforcement will also enable European companies to export to and invest in an ever-growing market and to bid for a number of public procurements. A crucial impetus must be taken for an ambitious and balanced economic partnership.\n\n<b>Climate Change, Defence</b>\n\nThe six-month French Presidency of the EU, from July 1 to Dec. 31, is focusing on several priorities, two of which (climate change and defence policy) directly concern Canada and will be touched on during the summit.\n\nFirst, the EU-Canada Summit will provide a means for discussion regarding climate change. European countries hope to obtain ambitious results with the "energy-climate" package presented by the European Commission. A strong political impetus for the post-Kyoto period must be given at the 2009 Copenhagen Conference.\n\nThe EU is ready to lead the way in this regard. It is unanimously committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020. Collectively, we committed to this goal even before defining technicalities and before obtaining a commitment from the major world economies. \n\nThis is a big issue because we are, without a doubt, the last generation that can prevent irreversible damage to our planet.\n\nCertain countries claim that they "are ready to do something under the condition that the others start first." The EU is challenging this reasoning since it implies that a decision will not be made on time. If we do not lead the way, we will have no authority to ask emerging countries to make an effort in reducing GHG emissions. \n\nGranted, these countries are saying "We have been developing for the past 10 years so don''t get in the way." We believe that there is a way to convince every country to do their part, and France will work with the European Commission towards this goal. For example, the European Investment Bank (EIB) lent 500 million Euros to China with a view to encourage its efforts to reduce climate change. The EU will also adopt a CO2 capture directive, an issue that is also closely followed in Canada and that could lead to a collaboration between the EU and Canada. \n\nSecond, the European defence policy: regularly, European military forces fight and work alongside the Canadian army in different theatres of operations. Almost all Member States of the EU have soldiers in Afghanistan. Our co-operation in this country and, more generally, our work program for managing civil and military crisis, will be mentioned at the next summit. Today, we hope to move forward with the European defence concept by reinforcing NATO since a stronger European defence means a stronger NATO.\n\nDuring his address to the European Parliament on July 10, the French president emphasized that "the choice is not between a European defence and NATO; it is NATO and an autonomous European security policy. It is both at the same time and not one against the other."\n\n\n<b>Time to Boost Partnership</b>\n\nThe French Presidency has set other priorities for this second semester. For the record, I will make reference to the common agriculture policy assessment and the immigration policy, an area in which Canada benefits from great experience.\n\nOn July 7, in Cannes, the ministers of the Interior agreed on a policy regarding the European immigration and asylum pact. Europe needs immigration: between 2010 and 2030, 25 million workers will be lost. The pact aims to better organize legal immigration based on workflow needs and the capabilities of each government and each population''s willingness towards integration.\n\nThe Schengen area, which authorizes free movement between citizens of participating Member States, has grown. There is a need for external border security, joint monitoring and joint negotiations regarding readmission agreements. This pact also aims to align European rules regarding asylum: it is not acceptable for an applicant to receive a different response from one government to another. \n\nBased on the values and interests that we, Europeans, share with Canadians, the time has come to boost the partnership between the EU and Canada. At the EU-Canada Summit, on Oct. 17, as president of the European Union, France will apply every effort to bring a crucial impetus to this new partnership.\n\n<i>Jean-Pierre Jouyet is France''s minister of state responsible for European affairs.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'jouyet-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);INSERT INTO `story` (`story_id`, `story_title`, `story_brief`, `story_content`, `story_kicker`, `story_cutline`, `story_section_id`, `story_section_heading_id`, `story_super_section_id`, `story_front_page`, `story_order`, `story_url_id`, `story_issue_date`, `story_status`, `story_updated`, `story_lock_current_issue`, `story_lock_archives`, `story_hit_view`, `story_hit_email`, `story_hit_blog`) VALUES (5967, '<b> It''s Time to Strengthen the Ties that Bind Us </b>  \n', 'The next EU-Canada Summit, which will be held in Montreal on Oct.', 'The next EU-Canada Summit, which will be held in Montreal on Oct. 17,<sup> </sup>will be an opportunity for the leaders of Canada and the EU, represented by the Presidency, currently France, and the European Commission and Council, to agree to move forward in a number of areas, such as trade and investment, where both sides want to strengthen our economic partnership. \n\nIn preparation, we have undertaken a joint study to set out the parameters of such an economic partnership. If we decide to launch a new economic agreement with Canada, the EU would hope for an ambitious agenda going far beyond a classic trade agreement&mdash;one that can help us both address the challenges of the new globalized economy of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. \n\nAs a first step towards strengthening our bilateral economic relations, at the end of last year we launched negotiations for an EU-Canada "Open Skies" Air Services Agreement. Our goal is to sign an agreement with Canada whereby any airline could fly from anywhere in Canada to anywhere in the European Union, and vice versa. Our experience within Europe has demonstrated that such an agreement would open up new destinations and routes to both EU and Canadian airlines, while increasing efficiency and reducing fares. \n\nThe EU is fully committed to this process and we are prepared to conclude the Open Skies Agreement as soon as possible. It is an agreement where the travelling public will see immediate and tangible results.\n\nAt the summit in Montreal, we will also compare notes on climate change, one of the big challenges of our time, which must be addressed&mdash;and with all countries on board. Despite the high costs and the sacrifices, we have made significant progress in Europe, and we have an exemplary and operational carbon-trading scheme in place. \n\nAs well, we will discuss global stability, security and our military missions, including Afghanistan, where both the EU and Canada are working closely to bring peace, stability and prosperity to the region. In addition to the military missions, under NATO, the EU&mdash;in close co-operation with Canada&mdash;is actively engaged in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, as well as in humanitarian endeavours, in order to improve the lives of the people of Afghanistan.\n\nI would like to express our appreciation to Canada, which provides the largest contingent of police to the EU-led police mission to Afghanistan, which is training and assisting the local Afghan police forces. \n\nOur efforts to bring peace, security and prosperity to Afghanistan come naturally, as that has been our goal in Europe since we established our common institutions and policies in Europe in the period after the Second World War.\n\nFrom six countries in the early 1950s, the European Union has now grown to 27 Member States, in the process creating not just peace, security, stability and prosperity, but an integrated economic and political entity. Also, the European Union as such has gradually become a major international actor, both economically as the largest trading bloc and politically.\n\nWe act in partnership with countries such as Canada, which share our values of democracy, freedom, economic enterprise, justice and the rule of law.\n\nLastly, I would like to emphasize how much the European Union appreciates Canada lifting the visa requirements for our new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe. These countries suffered much during the Second World War and were then subjected to a totalitarian Communist regime behind the Iron Curtain for 40 years. Today they are free, members of the EU, and have the highest growth rates in Europe. I hope the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania too will soon also enjoy visa free travel to Canada.\n\nIn conclusion let me extend my congratulations on the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of Quebec City this year.

It will grow to 28 in the coming year, with the addition of Albania and Croatia. Together with 23 Partnership for Peace nations, three of which were recently added in 2006, they currently represent a potent security forum of 50 like-minded nations in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. Added to this are the seven Mediterranean Dialogue partner countries that were welcomed in a separate partnership in 2004, the four Gulf States, with which NATO has been co-operating since the 2004 Istanbul Co-operation Initiative, and contact countries to include Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea, which have also been actively involved with NATO in dialogue, consultation and military-to-military co-operation since 2006.   \n\nAs a large international organization whose activities are based on the principle that all its members have an equal voice and equal vote, NATO can at times make for an easy target to criticize. It can sometimes take a long time to agree to a policy. Transformation is happening more slowly than we would like. There are force generation and capability shortfalls in Afghanistan and for other NATO operations and activities. Declarations of political commitment do not always directly equate to deployable, or deployed, military capabilities.\n\nThat is an often-told narrative. What is less often told or shown, and thus less well understood, is the story of how much NATO has changed, how it is adjusting to meet the security challenges of tomorrow.\n\nLess than 20 years ago, NATO consisted of 16 members, counted none as partners, and had conducted no operations or exercises outside its member state borders. It prepared for high-intensity defensive operations on European soil and relied on a well developed and in-place logistics and communications infrastructure to support it. The organization was buttressed by literally thousands of bases and stations and an enormous quantity of material and personnel available on short notice to guard against direct military attack.\n\nToday, NATO counts 26 members and 38 other countries in four partnership arrangements. Two of these countries, Albania and Croatia, are joining NATO and two others, Georgia and Ukraine, are engaged in intensified engagement, leading to their own membership. \n\nCollectively, NATO has increased the deployability of its forces, significantly upgraded equipment, closed scores of bases, destroyed thousands of pieces of material, and shed hundreds of thousands of personnel&mdash;all simultaneously. In a few short years, NATO has conducted eight operations on four continents. Many NATO allies also support military operations under the auspices of the United Nations, the European Union, or in coalitions.\n\nThat is a remarkable transformation record by any standard. \n\nStill, NATO is not resting on its laurels. It is actively engaged in the debate about broader security issues, including what role it should play in energy security, cyber defence, enhanced maritime security, and how to work more closely with all actors involved in major operations. It is working hard to re-adjust and retool its mechanisms and processes to more effectively deal with the growth in the number and complexity of issues and initiatives, including pressure to find further savings in headquarters overheads and concurrently to be more deployable. \n\nIt does not seem that the pace of activity will lessen anytime soon. The upcoming summits are going to be critical to the future orientation of the alliance and its partners, resulting in key political decisions on enlargement, enhancements to our military capabilities, and will shape how we conduct our operations. \n\nOn a more personal note, I have learned and take away many insights from my time as chairman of the military committee, among which are:\n\n&bull; Consensus-based decision-making is key to the work this alliance does. Having all nations agree to a policy (or at least, have them agree not to say no)&mdash;can be time-consuming, and at times result in "lowest common denominator" language. Still, consensus is the very basis on which the small and moderately resourced have the same voice as the large and the relatively well-resourced, and is the founding and enduring principle of an alliance dedicated to all having equal rights and responsibilities.\n\n&bull; Communicating with our publics is an increasingly important undertaking for all who serve the alliance. At virtually every country visit, military and political leaders were joined in one message&mdash;that in a crowded information marketplace, the alliance and its partners need to increase their efforts to explain, tell and show the NATO story to all of our publics, and to our adversaries.\n\n&bull; The forum that NATO provides for discussion and dialogue of security and defence matters is unmatched. The unparalled access and exposure to policies, programs, activities and undertakings of the various nations make for a tremendous forcing agent for change and driver of operational interoperability.\n\nFinally, what does all this mean for Canada?  \n\nHaving seen NATO emerge from this challenging period stronger and more sure of its identity, and having a good idea where this transformation will take the alliance, I would suggest that Canadians may be surprised to realize how much is going on in this alliance, especially the fact that Afghanistan, while important, is only one activity amongst a myriad of global engagements that has raised NATO''s profile on the world stage.  \n\nGiven how well respected Canada is within the alliance, I believe there is an opportunity for our nation to broaden its engagement in NATO and take advantage of this dynamic alliance by investing more senior civilian and military representatives in Brussels and throughout the chain of command, who can ensure that Canada''s best interests continue to be understood and appreciated by its allies and partner.  Furthermore, Canadian policymakers can help broaden the debate on NATO by highlighting to Canadians, through a proactive public affairs program, not just the Afghanistan mission, but the other equally important issues facing this transatlantic alliance because, in my view, NATO is good for Canada and Canada is good for NATO.\n\n<i>Retired general Ray Henault served as NATO''s chairman of the military committee from June 2005 to June 2008.

The larger South and Central Asian region in which it is located matters to Canadian policy in Afghanistan.  Nevertheless, our engagement in Afghanistan is carried out principally through NATO, a European organization.  The health of the alliance and European politics and security is therefore vital to Canada''s other foreign policy goals.\n\nNowhere is this more the case than in Southeast Europe.  While the transition from state communism to constitutional democracy was smooth in some countries (Vaclav Havel''s "Velvet Revolution" comes to mind), the transition in the Balkans has been punctuated by instability and violence.\n\nWhat happens in Europe directly impinges on the alliance mission in Afghanistan.  If relations between NATO member countries are acrimonious, the business of sorting out our security concerns beyond the Euro-Atlantic area will be much more difficult.  This was the case at the Bucharest Summit, where issues of controversial membership enlargement plans and ballistic missile defence eclipsed Afghanistan.\n\nThe recognition that co-operative political relations are keys to co-operation in the security field is as old as the alliance itself. Lester B. Pearson recognized this fact and worked hard in NATO''s early years to strengthen political consultation as a means to improve military co-operation.  In fact, Pearson often spoke of the alliance as the "Atlantic Community" to underscore the potential for good-neighbourly relations from Ottawa to Ankara.\n\nSo a Europe-based organization increasingly active on a global level must have its own house in order.  In Southeast Europe, this means addressing some of the lingering disputes that threaten the expansion of a zone of peace across the continent. \n\nThe arrest last month of Radovan Karadjic will go a long way in helping the region move on from its war-torn past and will provide much closure to survivors of atrocities.  But much work remains to be done.\n\nThe process of integrating Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo into the European security community must continue and must be done skilfully in a region feeling the effects of the latter''s declaration of independence. \n\nThe rejection of the Republic of Macedonia''s NATO membership bid threatens the hard work that has been put into consolidating regional stability.  Coming in the wake of Kosovo''s declaration of independence, the decision risks undermining the tremendous progress Skopje has made in the direction of Euro-Atlantic integration, including the contribution of military personnel to the NATO mission in Afghanistan.\n\nThe alliance needs a stable and secure Macedonia in its midst.  The rejection of a democratic European country on the basis of its constitutional name, a name recognized the world-over, raises serious questions about the health of relations in Europe.  NATO should admit Macedonia as soon as possible under its constitutional name.  \n\nWe Canadians have a strong European policy legacy to draw on.  Our longstanding interest in European peace and stability results from our participation in two world wars, 40 years of stationing our forces in Central Europe, and 30 years of UN peacekeeping in Cyprus.  As a country with a large number of citizens of Central and Eastern European extraction, Canada made the promotion of human rights a focus of its diplomatic efforts during the long-running Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n\nWith the end of the Cold War, we were able to extend the peaceful, friendly relations we enjoyed with Western Europe eastward to the emerging democracies of the region.  Canada was a strong supporter of pan-European Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the process of institutionalization it underwent in the 1990s. Through our bilateral relations with Norway, we worked tirelessly on human security issues. We made a major commitment to restoring peace and stability in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, and the Republic of Macedonia.   \n\nFor the sake of an active, global Euro-Atlantic alliance we need to build on that tradition today.\n\n<i>Liberal MP Lui Temelkovski for Oak Ridges-Markham, served as an OSCE election monitor in Serbia in 2007.

Intelcan, Canam Steel (with its large site in Brasov) and Montreal Airport Services are all among the top companies contributing to Romania''s infrastructure development.\n\n<i>Forbes Business Week</i> ranked Romania 40<sup>th</sup> of 121 countries, with analysts stating that our country has recorded the best ranking criteria in monetary liberalization, property protection, innovation and technology.\n\nRomania enjoys certain competitive advantages and a business friendly environment that encourages foreign investors to develop their business here. This trend will continue in the following years. \n\nRomania''s accession to the European Union in January 2007 was a confirmation of the social, political and economic stability that foreign investors look for when they decide to come to a certain country.\n\nThe constant economic growth recorded in the last few years has opened up new business opportunities. In the first quarter of 2008, Romania registered the second biggest growth among the European Union Member States.\n\nMoreover, EU membership gives Romania the opportunity to access structural funds that already contribute to the development of infrastructure. We are at the beginning of a long way to the modernization of Romania''s infrastructure. Within this context, I would highlight the opportunities arising in the fields of construction and real estate, with high profit rates in the last few years. \n\nThe general availability of EU funds is contributing significantly to the improvement of the business environment. In pursuing the same goal, the Romanian government has also taken a number of bold, important decisions. The present government adopted a flat tax policy (16 per cent) four years ago, immediately after being sworn in. This measure has led to a better capitalization of the enterprises, has encouraged their development and has determined a substantial increase of the state budget revenues.\n\nThis positive trend was confirmed by the sustained economic growth of the last four years. The first quarter of 2008 has recorded eight per cent growth and we are confident that this pace will be further maintained.\n\nRomanian authorities also adopted regulations designed to reduce bureaucracy and simplify legal procedures. We simplified the regime of individuals authorized to develop economic activities. Our objective was to create the proper conditions for the functioning of economic entities with a minimum monitoring role of the state.\n\nAll these measures aim at strengthening the fiscal discipline and establishing simple, clear and coherent rules. We believe these decisions stand as important and real arguments for the Canadian businessmen to consider investing more in Romania. \n\nOur country is strategically positioned at the crossroads of traditional commercial and energy routes. Romania is already a hub for regional businesses and Bucharest hosts the headquarters of important multinational companies. \n\nCompanies that decide to come to Romania find here another significant asset, that of a very well trained labour force.\n\nThe top quality of Romanian education is recognized worldwide; young people are aware of the complex challenges of the labour market in a globalized world and this contributes to maintaining high education standards in our schools. Universities are encouraged to keep up with change and constantly adjust their curricula in order to match the labour market demands.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that, after a relatively difficult period in the early 1990s, sustained reforms have hugely improved the banking and financial services sector. Important European banks have benefited from the skilled labour force and positive business environment in Romania and opened branches in Bucharest. \n\nRomania attaches great importance to the development of the technological sector. Industrial parks offering good infrastructure and facilities host foreign companies and joint-ventures. Meanwhile, the car industry and IT sectors continue to grow, thanks to important investments in the last years.\n\nLast but not least, Romania is an important market itself, with a population of 22 million whose living standards and demand for diversified goods and services are growing. \n\nThere are great business opportunities in many other fields, of which agriculture or regional developments are only a few examples. After years of focusing on Bucharest, investors are now discovering other cities of Romania. The continuous development of the regional infrastructure, to which the Romanian government is fully committed, will surely open up new opportunities. \n\nI would invite Canadian businesspeople to pay increased attention to our country and I am confident that our economic ties will constantly grow over the coming years. Come invest in Romania, it is worth the effort.\n\n<i>Lazar Comanescu is Romania''s minister of foreign affairs.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'comanescu-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5971, '<b> Switzerland: A Partnership with Promising Perspectives </b>  \n', 'Switzerland is the fifth largest foreign direct investor in Canada and one of the most important countries of origin of foreign direct investments worldwide.', 'Switzerland is the fifth largest foreign direct investor in Canada and one of the most important countries of origin of foreign direct investments worldwide. Economically, Switzerland, as a small country in the heart of Europe, is punching above its size.\n\nRelations between Canada and Switzerland have their roots back in the 17<sup>th</sup> century when the first Swiss emigrants arrived in Canada and predominantly were engaged in farming and trade.\n\nIn the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, numerous Swiss mountain guides found a livelihood and a new home in Canada. The several summits in the Rocky Mountains named for Swiss regions still remind us of the Swiss pioneers who conquered many peaks back in those days.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the professional background of Swiss immigrants diversified. Today, Canada hosts the fifth-largest Swiss colony in the world (36,000 Swiss nationals). Canada is not just a very attractive location for Swiss individuals, but also for companies.\n\nThe economic ties between our two countries are strong. Canada is Switzerland''s fifth most important trading partner in the world after the European Union, the United States, Japan and China. From the Canadian perspective, Switzerland ranked 18<sup>th</sup> for exports as well as for imports. Regarding foreign direct investments in Switzerland, Canada is the 13<sup>th</sup> most important country of origin.\n\nThe transatlantic economic relations between Canada and Switzerland have been developing tremendously in the last couple of years and will be certainly strengthened in the future.\n\nIn 2007, the increase of Swiss exports of 6.5 per cent was based mainly on exports of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, machines, precision instruments and watches. At the same time, Swiss imports from Canada grew by 33.5 per cent and consisted mostly of pharmaceuticals, airplanes and vehicles, machines and agricultural goods.\n\nIn 2007, Swiss firms held foreign direct investments of $13.8 billion and employed approximately 32,500 Canadians. \n\nAs foreign direct investors in Canada, Switzerland ranked behind the U.S., United Kingdom, Netherlands and France and before Japan, Brazil and Germany. In the last decade, Swiss capital stocks have tripled and have experienced a particular sharp increase since 2003. This is mainly due to large investments in the sectors of finance, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, food and building materials. \n\nOn the occasion of the World Economic Forum in Davos/Switzerland, Canada and the member states of the European Free Trade Association&mdash;Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland&mdash;signed a free trade agreement in January 2008. It will come into force on Jan. 1, 2009 after completion of parliamentary procedures. Thereby, the economic ties between Canada and Switzerland will be strengthened significantly.\n\nThe Canada-EFTA FTA places the emphasis on the removal of customs duties on industrial goods and some processed agricultural goods, as well as other trade barriers. As for selected non-processed agricultural products, the EFTA states have concluded individual bilateral agreements. Switzerland is a country dependent on exports with diversified markets worldwide. Therefore, the conclusion of FTAs with important partner countries&mdash;alongside its membership to the WTO and the contractual relations with the European Union&mdash;is one of the three main pillars of its policy of market liberalization and of improving the general conditions for foreign trade.\n\nThe FTA offers advantages to both Swiss and Canadian firms by mutually improving market access. The high quality of life, the excellent infrastructure and the abundance of natural resources contribute to Canada''s attractiveness for Swiss firms. In the next decade, Canada will certainly continue to grow considerably and improve its competitiveness. For Canada to reach its objectives, in particular in the areas of environmental protection and health, Swiss technology and know-how can be a valuable contributor.\n\nThe Canada-EFTA FTA is Canada''s first free trade agreement since the coming into effect of the Canada-Costa Rica FTA in 2002. With this agreement, the Canadian government underlines its intention to enhance the access of Canadian firms to foreign markets by means of bilateral free trade agreements. It also offers Canadian businesses a foothold in the heart of the broader EU market. \n\nIn close co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada and the regional offices of International Trade Canada, the embassies and the consulates general of the EFTA states in Canada will organize, in the fall of 2008, all-day promotional events across Canada to give potential Canadian investors and business partners a better understanding of the business opportunities that the EFTA economies have to offer.\n\nThe roadshow for the Canada-EFTA FTA will start off in Toronto, on Oct. 27 and end in Vancouver, on Nov. 5. Presentations are also planned in Montreal, St. John''s, Halifax, Charlottetown, Moncton, Calgary, and Edmonton. Switzerland will use these opportunities to present itself as a highly attractive location for business and investments.\n\nSwiss diplomatic representations in Canada not only promote Switzerland as investment and business location, but also introduce Swiss companies to opportunities of the Canadian market. Some of Switzerland''s largest companies, such as Nestl&eacute;, Novartis, Roche, Syngenta and the Swiss major banks and insurance companies are already established on the Canadian market, where they play a significant role.\n\nSmall- and medium-sized enterprises too have contributed considerably to the productivity of Canadian manufacturing, energy and agriculture among others. Swiss companies considering whether to enter the Canadian market require specific information and access to networks. It is one of the priorities of the Swiss Embassy and the consulates general in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver to provide assistance in this process, in particular to the SME.\n\nThe Swiss diplomatic representations are committed to their role as door-opener for Swiss small and medium-sized enterprises and provide their services in co-operation with different Swiss governmental agencies, such as OSEC Business Network Switzerland or the various Swiss Canadian Chambers of Commerce in Canada.\n\n<i>Werner Baumann is Switzerland''s ambassador to Canada.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'baumann-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5972, '<b> Overcoming Inertia Towards Economic Prosperity </b>  \n', 'In June 2007, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and then-president of the European Council, Angela Merkel, met in Berlin and discussed a new initiative for transatlantic economic relations.', 'In June 2007, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and then-president of the European Council, Angela Merkel, met in Berlin and discussed a new initiative for transatlantic economic relations.\n\nThe meeting resulted in establishing a joint working group for preparing a study on the "costs and benefits" of closer economic relations. This study will probably be released late in the summer of this year.\n\nGiven the rather unsuccessful history of bilateral efforts to strengthen the economic relationship, the rather hesitant tone of the joint declaration from a year ago comes as no surprise.\n\nFrom a Canadian perspective, there may have been no dire need for any such initiative at all. The 27 member states of the EU already represent the second-largest market for Canadian exporters, and are the second-largest foreign direct investors in the Canadian economy.\n\nIn other words, it appears that Canadian companies perform well in their economic relations with Europe, and that other, more dynamic and growing areas of the global economy are in more urgent need for political cultivation than the established European markets.\n\nFrom a European perspective, Canada is a relatively small market and not high enough of a priority for additional efforts to negotiate a more far-reaching and ambitious economic partnership agreement. Although circumstances dramatically changed due to the ongoing and deepening recession in the U.S., such attitudes may prevail in some corners of Canada and the EU and hinder a deeper relationship between both entities.\n\nHowever, these attitudes misinterpret the strategic interests on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nFirst, the established multilateral principles of the global trading system seem to be endangered with the death of the Doha round.\n\nCanada, more so than the EU, urgently needs to catch up with the ongoing process of bilateral and regional trade agreements. The initiative for a deeper economic partnership with the EU can be seen as a reflection of this need. \n\nThe current economic state of the United States signals a fundamental change in its global economic position. The U.S. is no longer the lone economic superpower of the global economy. Its structural trade deficit needs to be reduced. This could be possible through a combined increase of exports, a reduction of imports, and a steep and ongoing depreciation of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe ongoing destruction of private wealth in the financial markets of the U.S. might spark a market-driven reduction of its past over-consumption and lead to the necessary increase of its saving rate.\n\nFor the global economy, such a process implies that the most important export destination will lose steam. In 2008, Canada starts feeling the shrinking of U.S. growth.  The emerging market economies of Asia will most likely compensate for parts of this loss.\n\nThe most important side effect of a lower U.S. dollar is the steep rise in the price for oil, and this endangers global economic growth all over the place. Economies like Canada''s, which send the vast bulk of their exports to the U.S., need to quickly shift the geographical destination of their exports\n\n Improving Canada''s economic relationship with the EU, the largest common market in the world, may be just the timely step needed.  Canada&mdash;albeit a "small economy"&mdash;has all the features of an attractive economic partner for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.\n\nDue to high global oil prices and dramatic technical progress in the area of oil exploitation, the Canadian oils sands now give the country access to the second-largest worldwide oil reserves. As those reserves provide environmental challenges due to associated increased carbon emissions, transatlantic technological alliances will become highly attractive for European companies.\n\nWith its income per capita, Canada belongs to the top group of developed market economies that offer market opportunities for sophisticated consumers and investors.\n\nYet despite these structural issues, the political ambitions on both sides of the Atlantic for deepening economic relations are modest. This reluctance does not necessarily reflect public opinion on trade and economic globalization. Unlike in the U.S., where over the last few years public attitudes concerning trade and globalization have become more skeptical, Canadians, as well as the larger trading societies of the EU, are strong supporters of trade and globalization.\n\nFollowing the latest PEW data, 82 per cent of Canadians have an overall positive attitude towards foreign trade. This figure is only surpassed by Germans and Swedes at 85 per cent. Among Europeans, only Italians are turning skeptical towards international trade. However, their share of positive opinions, at 68 per cent, is higher than the U.S.''s 59 per cent.\n\nCanadians and Europeans not only strongly support foreign trade, but the same poll also demonstrates that both Canadians and Europeans are overwhelmingly in favour of strong welfare states that provide a social safety net for those left behind by the economic consequences of globalization and free trade. Politically, this combination is much more strongly expressed in the European compared to the Canadian case.\n\nThe same PEW data show that those attitudes also hold regarding a sustainable environment: Canadians and Europeans value a safer natural environment more than economic growth.\n\nThese shared values generate a concrete foundation for a closer Canada-EU economic partnership. An initiative based on these common values in the 21<sup>st</sup> century should be used by political actors on both sides of the Atlantic to move forward with an agreement that covers "fair" trade as well as environmental concerns.\n\nCitizens in Canada and Europe appear to be ready for this type of partnership. It is now up to the political classes to make it happen.\n\n<i>Kurt H&uuml;bner is director of the University of British Columbia''s Institute for European Studies and a researcher with the Canada-Europe Transatlantic Dialogue.</i>\n\n\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'hubner-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5973, '<b> Not America: The Great European Disconnect </b>  \n', '<b><i>Where Have All The Soldiers Gone?

Sheehan</b>\n\n<b>Houghton Mifflin</b>\n\n<b>284 pp. $29.95 </b>\n\nIn recent years, especially since 9/11 and the Iraq war, so much has been said about America being from Mars while Europe is from Venus that it''s about time someone tried to figure out how the great disconnect came about.\n\nWe know that most Americans, by approving the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and accepting the idea of a "war on terrorism," believe their country has the right to use violence to resolve international disputes.\n\nHowever, Europeans, for the most part, have consistently refused to be drawn into fighting conflicts, even when some of their national leaders did not agree with them.\n\nIn short, war in Europe has become obsolete while in America it is still promoted as a solution to difficult problems.\n\nAnd so lies the heart of the great disconnect between Europe and America, while other nations like Canada are struggling to find their footing between the two sides. The European Union, at its core, has become a civilian society while America remains a war economy.\n\nThus is the conclusion of Stanford University Professor James J. Sheehan, whose very helpful and lucid history of peace and war in modern Europe, <i>Where Have All the Soldiers Gone?</i>, breaks the news to us gently: the continent is no longer an armed camp, nor does it ever want to be one again.\n\nThere was a time when European countries defined their nationalism by the courage of their soldiers. And citizens defined their loyalties by their willingness to kill or die for the preservation of the state. But a war that took 50 million lives and displaced another 60 million people shook Europe to its roots. Europe was ready for a new idea. That idea came about as a result of a speech by French foreign minister Robert Schuman in May 9, 1950, which had to do with the creation of an organization to control coal and steel production in Europe. That gave birth to the European Coal and Steel Community, which in turn became the European Economic Community and then the European Union. \n\n"Europe will not be made all at once," said the visionary Schuman, "or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity."\n\nNo wonder America hardly noticed the revolutionary events that had transpired and the radical changes that had slowly taken place across the Atlantic. Each step was small and practical. But, step-by-step, the new Europe grew.\n\nBefore the countries of Europe became "civilian states," which Sheehan defines as "Countries that didn''t lose the capacity to make war but lost the desire," Europe suffered in a way that Americans and Canadians will never understand. There were no vast oceans to protect the civilian populations of Europe from the incessant raping, killing and destruction that ruled the continent during the Second World War.\n\n"Europeans know, in a way few Americans can, what war is really like," says Sheehan. "And while the ranks of those who directly experienced the world wars are thinning, the collective memory of those terrible times&mdash;the London Blitz, the occupation of France, the Battle of Berlin, the agony of the Warsaw uprising, and the prolonged purgatory of the eastern front&mdash;remains. Set against these memories, indeed set against any other period in European history, the creation of the civilian state seems like something to be cherished, celebrated and preserved."\n\nThat civilian state, with its small defence budgets, low-profile and professional military, whose personnel more closely resemble police than soldiers, all attest to the obsolescence of war. \n\nBut Sheehan is not saying that war has grown obsolete all over the world. Far from it. He claims only two central arguments: "first, the obsolescence of war is not a global phenomenon but a European one, the product of Europe''s distinctive history in the twentieth century; second, the disappearance of war after 1945 created both a dramatically new international system within Europe and a new kind of European state."\n\nThat new international system has become extremely visible since Europe parted company with America over the "war on terrorism." While Americans were tending to see terrorism as a global movement that threatened their national security&mdash;9/11 was an analogy for Pearl Harbor&mdash;Europeans, who had been fighting their own forms of terrorism for decades, saw it very differently.\n\nTerrorism in Europe was, writes Sheehan: "a persistent challenge to domestic order rather than an immediate international threat. The proper remedy was more effective policing, stricter laws, and better surveillance. They wanted to extradite terrorists and try them as criminals, not wage war against states that were suspected of supporting them."\n\nPeace is a modern invention and during the period of history that Sheehan covered in his book, it is clear that Europe had to learn peace the hard way.\n\n"It is necessary to put an end once and for all to the papist and Quaker babble about the sanctity of human life," said Communist revolutionary Leon Trotsky as he led the Red Army in the violent birth of the Soviet Union that claimed 1.2 million lives. \n\n In France, of the 1.3 million people who were killed in the First World War, a third of the war dead could not be identified. The rules of war had been changed. \n\nCivilians were now fair game as French bombers destroyed a circus tent full of German children in Karlsruhe, German bombers killed 1,413 people in London and German submarines sunk the <i>Lusitania</i> with 1,200 people aboard, mostly women and children. A British blockade of Germany until 1919 starved tens of thousands of Germans to death and made a greater number infirm.\n\nIt may not have been possible to imagine anything worse in 1914, but the Second World War was worse.\n\nHow this bloodthirsty history could ever evolve into states where military "death is no longer seen as being part of the social contract" is a fascinating story told by a gifted historian who never seems tempted to bash us over the head with his knowledge. He brings us along with gentle eloquence and an absence of ideology.\n\nSheehan doesn''t claim to have the answer as to how Europe will continue to cope with an America of large defence budgets, death penalties and legalized gun mania. Nor does he suggest how Europe may protect itself from an extremely violent world outside its borders. But he does tell us why he is sure that the EU will never be a superpower. And why Europe''s soft power is far more valuable to itself and to the rest of the world&mdash;including America.\n\n<i>jim@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'books-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5974, '<b>Ottawa Cultural Listings</b>  \n', '<i>Submit your Ottawa-based event to listings@embassymag.ca or fax to 613-232-9055 by Friday at 5p.m.</i>\n\n<b> WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 20</b>\n\n<b>GreekFest: Dance Performances</b><i> 1315 Prince of Wales (613-225-8016;www.ottawagreekfest.com) 6:15p.m.', '<i>Submit your Ottawa-based event to listings@embassymag.ca or fax to 613-232-9055 by Friday at 5p.m.</i>\n\n<b> WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 20</b>\n\n<b>GreekFest: Dance Performances</b><i> 1315 Prince of Wales (613-225-8016;www.ottawagreekfest.com) 6:15p.m. </i>Live life the Greek way!

The classes convene thrice yearly, sometimes in exotic locales such as Costa Rica, Spain, Singapore, Athens, the Hague... or Ottawa!\n\nIntegral to the GMAP program are role-playing exercises that use L20 simulations as a training ground for international consensus building. \n\nThe 8,000 living graduates of the Boston-based Fletcher School populate positions in politics and government around the world and boast among their alumni the prime minister of Greece, the foreign minister of Indonesia, the Libyan energy secretary and a plethora of ambassadors around the world.\n\nA few Fletcher grads are even here in Ottawa, among them Afghan Ambassador to Ottawa <b>Omar Samad</b> and Pakistan High Commissioner <b>Musa Javed Chohan</b>.\n\n\n<b>CDAI Honours Hillier</b>\n\nAlso proving he''s still on the scene this week, charismatic former chief of the Canadian defence staff retired general <b>Rick Hillier</b> has received a tip of the hat from Canada''s defence establishment. \n\nAt a dinner held Friday at the main hall of the Canadian War Museum, Mr. Hillier was presented with the 2008 Vimy Award.\n\nThe award is given annually by the Conference of Defence Associations Institute.\n\nThe award was first given out in 1991 to former Progressive Conservative prime minister Joe Clark.

Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS at St. Paul''s Hospital in Vancouver, was named president of the International AIDS Society.\n\nIn an interview with <i>Embassy</i> last week, he explains that his passion and vocal activism&mdash;exemplified by his strong criticism of the Canadian government''s response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic&mdash;is reflective of the urgency the situation demands.\n\nAt a time where 35 years of research has immensely diminished the harm and risk associated with HIV and AIDS for thousands of people, Mr. Montaner says the global track record to deal with the disease is "pathetic."\n\nWorldwide, more than 33 million people are infected with HIV/AIDS, while last year, 2.7 million were newly infected and two million died of the disease. Of these deaths, 23,000 were in North America, while an estimated 54,000 in the region were newly infected.\n\nMr. Montaner, however, is determined to ensure that changes.\n\nThe tough-talking doctor&mdash;who, in case it wasn''t already clear, states that he will not be shy about criticizing governments&mdash;says he is prepared to take on political leaders worldwide, including South African President Thabo Mbeki and heads of the G8 power club, starting with the Conservatives in Canada.\n\nAlready, Mr. Montaner stands squarely, and publicly, at odds with federal Health Minister Tony Clement over Vancouver''s safe-injection site, Insite, and over just how outspoken medical researchers and scientists should be. \n\nMr. Clement recently made comments arguing that doctors such as Mr. Montaner have overstepped their role as researchers by lobbying to keep Insite open.\n\n"For him to call us advocates or fanatics, it doesn''t cut it," Mr. Montaner says.\n\nClearly frustrated by the minister''s opposition to Insite, Mr. Montaner says international leaders in medicine, and the World Health Organization, declared support for safe-injection sites at the AIDS conference, despite Mr. Clement voicing his objections.\n\n"This is a very pervasive attitude on the part of the federal government interfering with our ability to offer a low-threshold service to deal with some of the most difficult-to-reach individuals," he says. "It represents really a bias and unacceptable position that undermines some public health policy."\n\nMr. Montaner explains his clash with the government over medical policies as a "long-standing problem" and says the Conservatives need to realize they were elected by a conservative minority, but are to govern for all Canadians&mdash;including those infected with HIV/AIDS, whom he says are systematically neglected.\n\n"It''s shame in my position as president of the IAS, I feel I don''t have the support of the federal government, and I cannot be seen bringing my federal government with me to the table when we''re discussing these very important issues at the international level," Mr. Montaner says.\n\nSince 2006, the government has invested approximately $515 million to fight HIV/AIDS in developing countries, and earlier this month announced another $45 million towards projects responding to HIV/AIDS in Africa. \n\nMr. Montaner says these contributions fall far short of what Canada should be contributing, particularly when compared, on a per capita basis, to the amount pledged by U.S. President George W. Bush, who has tripled American funding for HIV/AIDS to $48 billion over the next five years. \n\nWith still years, if not decades, before the medical community produces a vaccine, Mr. Montaner has become one of the leading doctors to advocate for "Treatment as Prevention" to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV/AIDS. \n\nAlthough a somewhat controversial theory within the medical community, his recent research suggests that proper treatment can contribute to stopping HIV transmission from an infected person, and the provincial government in B.C. may provide funding. Many have concerns, however, that this could lead to irresponsible behaviour among those at risk who think they''ve been treated properly, but may still in fact transmit HIV.\n\n"We''ve shown in the paper we published on July 1<sup>st</sup> that if we were to expand anti-retroviral therapy from the current 50 per cent coverage among those with the medical indication to be treated, to a 75 per cent coverage, we would be in a situation where we would see a reduction of new HIV infections of about 30 per cent."\n\nExcited by the potential benefits of having governments lend their support, Mr. Montaner goes on to point out that although approximately 30 per cent of people who are HIV-positive in Canada are unaware they are infected, there is no comprehensive, aggressive national campaign for HIV testing.\n\n"This is very problematic," Mr. Montaner says. "So this is the fundamentals, if we can truly move in that regard, we can make a difference."\n\nA native of Argentina, Mr. Montaner is following a path similar to that carved by his father, Luis Montaner, a medical researcher and advocate for advancing treatment against tuberculosis and former president of the Argentina Medical Association.\n\nAs a child, Mr. Montaner followed his father to hospitals around Buenos Aires, entered medical school and, years later, began working at St. Paul''s Hospital in Vancouver.\n\nJust as his father had found a passion in treating TB patients, it was in 1985 that Mr. Montaner first delved into AIDS research. Within a decade, he had advanced a new and effective combination drug therapy, known as highly active anti-retroviral therapy, or HAART.\n\nNow, as he pursues the next chapter in combating HIV/AIDS, Mr. Montaner says that when considering the magnitude of the world''s task, he is driven by one of the most powerful statements  made in the fallout of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n"To me there''s something that keeps coming to my head and it''s a Colin Powell statement; where he referred to HIV/AIDS as the single biggest threat to global security even after 9/11."\n\n<i>mcollins@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'aids_chief-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5987, '<b> CIDA Internships Accountable, Effective </b>  \n', 'The Conservative government''s decision in September 2006 to pull the plug on a number of internship programs, including the Department of Foreign Affairs'' Young Professionals International program, was nothing short of appalling.', 'The Conservative government''s decision in September 2006 to pull the plug on a number of internship programs, including the Department of Foreign Affairs'' Young Professionals International program, was nothing short of appalling. No clear explanation for the move was given, and a quality replacement has yet to materialize.\n\nNow there are questions over what the government will be doing with the Canadian International Development Agency''s version of the same program. The International Youth Internship Program has been running since 1998 and has seen more than 5,000 young Canadians work overseas for a total cost of $66 million.\n\nEach new post-secondary graduate who lands one of the approximately 400 coveted six- to eight-month positions in a given year costs the government a paltry $15,000. Of that, $12,000 is set aside specifically for the intern and covers travel expenses, accommodation, vaccinations and visa costs. It also usually provides a small stipend to the participant. The other $3,000 goes to administrative costs for the Canadian organization setting the whole thing up.\n\nThe interns&mdash;all of whom must be inexperienced and/or under-employed in their chosen fields&mdash;generally work overseas for around six months, with the benefits widely felt.\n\nThe participants gain much needed experience in their chosen fields, without which many of them will find it extremely difficult to land a career. Anecdotal (and, in the case of the extremely similar DFAIT program, empirical) evidence indicates the majority of participants are highly sought after once their internships are finished. As an important side benefit, they also gain an understanding and connection with another part of the world.\n\nCanadian post-secondary institutions and civil society groups that set the internships up have the opportunity to connect with groups overseas, raise their own profiles and offer a way for their own graduates to gain some experience.\n\nOrganizations in developing countries, invariably with limited resources, will not only receive an educated and enthusiastic worker who wants to make a difference, but can learn from the intern''s own experiences and education. \n\nAnd the Canadian government, for a small price, gets 400 ambassadors per year to the world, helps make Canadian youth become employable, and can point to the program as a real and important effort to help developing countries.\n\nEarlier this year, the government, led by CIDA Minister Bev Oda and then-trade minister David Emerson, conducted a number of consultations with private industry and civil society organizations in an effort to better tailor a CIDA program that had, for all intents and purposes, wasted $500 million over a 10-year period.\n\nThe CIDA Inc. program doled the money out to private companies in the hopes it would encourage them to take a chance in risky developing countries, with the idea that a profitable initiative would also result in wealth creation, training and various other spinoffs in the recipient country.\n\nThe program was a disaster, yet the government remains intent on finding ways to get the private sector involved in development. How much the new program will cost has yet to be determined. In fact, the government hasn''t yet come out and said CIDA Inc. is a write-off.\n\nMeanwhile, the writing appears to be on the wall for the CIDA internships, despite glowing praise all around, including statements that the program is accountable and effective.\n\n"It''s a very inexpensive program," Lucien Bradet, president of the Canadian Council on Africa, told <i>Embassy</i> last week in defending the internship program. "I have not yet seen in this program any abuse or any mishaps."\n\nAccountable and effective: two words upon which this government says it wants to model Canadian aid policy.\n\nCanadians gaining experience and becoming more employable. NGOs and developing countries benefitting from having trained and skilled workers. Canada having ambassadors throughout the world.\n\nThe government''s decision to axe internships at Foreign Affairs and other departments was short-sighted and has done more damage than good. It doesn''t have to be like that with the CIDA program. It just makes sense to renew it.\n\n\n', '', NULL, 4, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'editorial-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5988, '<b> Georgia: The Breaking of NATO? </b>  \n', 'NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a remarkable case of institutional survival in the face of changing circumstances.', 'NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a remarkable case of institutional survival in the face of changing circumstances.  It was created in 1949 to protect Western Europe from the Soviet threat, and in 1989 the Soviet threat vanished. Yet NATO not only survived the collapse of the Soviet Union, but expanded, taking in all the former satellite states of Eastern Europe and even the Baltic republics that had been part of the Russian empire for more than 200 years.  But the Georgian debacle could break NATO.\n\nIn those Eastern European countries that were so recently ruled from Moscow, the presence of Russian troops in Georgia has reawakened all the old fears. On Thursday, Poland hastily agreed to let the United States place anti-ballistic missile sites on its soil, on condition that there must also be a full-fledged U.S. military base in the country. Why? Because then, if Russia attacked Poland, the United States would automatically become involved.\n\nWhat drives all this is historical memory, not genuine strategic calculation&mdash;Russia is not planning to attack Poland&mdash;but the emotions it evokes are very powerful. That''s also why 50 Estonian military volunteers have now arrived in Georgia (although nobody knows quite what to do with them).\n\nThe rhetoric in the new NATO members has been almost as hysterical as that in Georgia itself, where President Mikhail Saakashvili has been calling the Russians "21<sup>st</sup> century barbarians" who "despise everything new, everything modern, everything European, everything civilized." Similar rhetoric pervades the parallel universe of the U.S. media, where the fact that it was Georgia that started this war by unleashing a merciless artillery barrage on South Ossetia and then invading it has been virtually erased from the story-line.\n\nVery few Americans know that there was only one battalion of Russian peacekeeping troops (less than 1,000 men) in South Ossetia when the Georgian tanks rolled in less than two weeks ago. It''s all "plucky little Georgia" and democratic values versus the Russian bear.\n\nIt''s a rousing morality tale that hits all the right notes for an American sensibility, and it''s not just Georgia''s PR firms that are pushing this line. It''s also the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon, which had been building Georgia up as a key U.S. ally on Russia''s southern flank. Yet U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice looked deeply uncomfortable on Friday in Tbilisi as she stood beside the ranting Saakashvili.\n\nPerhaps she was pondering the fact that while the "new Europe" of former Soviet-bloc countries uncritically backs Georgia and the U.S. commitment there, the "old Europe" of Germany, France, Italy and their neighbours mostly does not. This is a problem if she wishes to pursue her goal of bringing Georgia and Ukraine into NATO, since "old Europe" is the core of NATO, with three times the population and five times the wealth of "new Europe."\n\nAny American secretary of state can rely on the reflex loyalty of the British government, at least in its current "New Labour" configuration, but none of the other great states of Western Europe thinks that having a confrontation with Russia over Georgia is a good idea. In fact, they think it''s crazy.\n\nAngela Merkel, the German chancellor, put it quite carefully after she met Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Friday: "Some of Russia''s actions were disproportionate [but] it is rare that all the blame is on one side. In fact, both sides are probably to blame. That is very important to understand."\n\nThe Italian government warned against trying to build an "anti-Moscow coalition." French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner works for the most pro-American French leader in recent history, President Nicolas Sarkozy, but he still said: "Don''t ask us who''s good and who''s bad here. We shouldn''t make any moral judgments on this war."\n\nThis will all be seen as "appeasement" by the neo-conservatives who still rule the roost in Washington, but many in Western Europe would call it common sense. The Russians will stay in Georgia until they have dismantled the Georgian army and navy bases that could threaten the ethnic enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhasia again, removing all the new American weaponry that gave Georgia an offensive military capability, and then they will withdraw to the enclaves as the ceasefire agreement requires.\n\nSarkozy brokered that ceasefire, and he agreed to write those clauses into it. He knew that they allowed Russian forces to stay on Georgian territory until the military threat had been nullified, and he accepted them. He did so because he did not really see Russia as an aggressor in this crisis (although he will not contradict America publicly by saying it in so many words). But if the U.S. pursues its goal of bringing Georgia and Ukraine into NATO, there are only three options.\n\nIf "old Europe" digs in its heals and refuses, on the grounds that it does not need Russia as an enemy, then either the United States drops its demand, or NATO breaks up.  The third alternative (and perhaps the likeliest) is that "old Europe" agrees to let the two former Soviet republics join&mdash;but with the unspoken reservation that they will never actually go to war with Russia to protect them. \n\nThat would be a less dramatic end for NATO, but it would be an end.\n\nA two-tier alliance is no alliance at all.\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 3, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'dyer-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5989, '<b> Fifteen Years of Neglect and Distraction </b>  \n', 'You know what makes no sense?

But surely it''s not greedy to want more than one? And if Canada has another natural ally, then surely it must be Europe. So many Canadians'' cultural roots lie there. Not only the British and French founders, but the waves of German, Italian, Hungarian, Polish and other immigrants who followed. Even the immigrants from Africa and Asia whose own home countries had British or French colonial histories. Put us all together and we''re practically family with that great Union across the ocean.\n\nBut it''s not just family interests and folkloric traditions that link us, or should. Europeans are rich. There are a lot of them. They work, produce, buy, enjoy culture high and low. When they look at the rest of the world they see the same challenges we do.\n\nAnd yet. Over the years I''ve grown used to meeting European diplomats who''ve slowly realized, a few months into their stay here, that they''re in for a pleasant, quiet time-&mdash;undisturbed by hard work because their Canadian hosts are barely aware of their presence among them.\n\nIn fact, it''s too gentle on Canada''s political leaders to speak of a "mutual" incomprehension because many Europeans I''ve met actually have quite a sophisticated understanding of what goes on in Canada. In Brussels several years ago I met an official who dealt with fisheries. We talked briefly about the Canadian fisheries minister of the day, Geoff Regan, and then the Eurocrat cut in: "But of course, John Efford is the real regional kingpin, isn''t he? I mean, nothing gets decided without his say-so, from what I''m told." This guy was clearly a lot more plugged in than the average <i>Globe and Mail</i> reader.\n\nMeanwhile back in Ottawa...\n\nOnce while he was Opposition leader, Stephen Harper paid a visit to a European diplomatic delegation. (I am being indiscreet here, because the list of Europeans Harper would ever have visited is not long.) Talk soon turned from bilateral concerns to Canada-EU matters&mdash;because to a European, there''s often no significant distinction between the two&mdash;and Harper started chatting about "Europe." It soon became clear that his understanding of European institutions was about three decades out of date. He went home with gentle suggestions for a reading list to get him up to speed.\n\nNow the thing about Harper is you can be nearly certain he read and remembered that homework. But he''s not the first Canadian leader to be out-of-date or off-track in his understanding of Europe. In fact, since the dawn of post-Maastricht Treaty Europe, near the end of 1993, Canada has been led by a succession of prime ministers with only a shaky understanding and an intermittent interest in what''s going on in Europe. And we''ve all paid a price for that.\n\nMaastricht replaced the European Community with a Union that would soon have a common currency and, for many members, a border-free interior (the Schengen zone). The level of economic integration required by these changes is formidable, and the level of legal and regulatory integration to accompany it meant that more than half the laws passed by member states'' parliaments are now designed to harmonize internal practice with EU norms.\n\nHello! Hellooooo? Any Canadian politicians left with us? No, I didn''t think so. We always skip the required reading. To skip over the fine print, then, every country in Europe became significantly less autonomous and a lot more "European" after 1993. So Europe grew deeper even as it was growing bigger, adding Sweden, Poland, Romania and a host of smaller countries. The EU as an institution, with its sometimes arcane rules, but also with its incredible human and economic potential, should have grown all the bigger in the Canadian political idea space.\n\nShould have.\n\nIn Brussels, Jean Chr&eacute;tien was seen as a man in love with French politics, too often to the exclusion of other European countries and with the EU in general. Chr&eacute;tien had a great stock of anecdotes about De Gaulle and Pierre Mendes France, and I don''t want to paint him as a Yesterday''s Man in general, but Europe changed long after he''d formed his ideas of Europe. He never bothered to catch up. The agenda for the twice-annual Canada-EU summits was invariably stultifyingly technical and boring. This annoyed the Europeans, who meet only annually with most of their other partners but who get a lot more done at those meetings.\n\nIn foreign affairs, as in other domains, Paul Martin was more interested in what was next than in what was actually going on. He was obsessed with China and India-&mdash;his speechwriter started calling them "Chindia" in conversation. But what are Chindia? Only this: Hundreds of millions of people who may soon have a massive, highly educated, globally-connected consumer class. The kind Europe already has. Europe today looks a lot like the Asia that so fascinated Martin, but nobody could get his attention.\n\nWell, anyone could get his attention, but nobody could keep it.\n\nHarper is a Realist, an Anglosphere Man, a Get-Things-Done Kind of Guy. He has no patience for froo-froo stuff like Brussels, with its Commissions and its weird rites. He made a show of cancelling the first Canada-EU summit after his election because he didn''t find the agenda worth his time. But then strange things started happening. His beloved Australians failed to re-elect his friend John Howard. The Iraq war stalled and Afghanistan, a burden he was happy to inherit, turned out harder than anyone expected. Harper discovered Canada could use friends. But the transatlantic relationship has suffered from a decade and a half of neglect and distraction.\n\nEurope has grown up while Canada has grown apart. The opportunity cost&mdash;the things we could be doing together, but aren''t&mdash;is enormous.

Before coming to Ottawa, Ms. Mukubwa was heading up Uganda''s social and human rights desk in Kampala.\n\nWhile posted in Nairobi, Ms. Mukubwa enjoyed being near her home and working closely with the United Nations Environment Program, but she says it was in London where she enjoyed the most success.\n\nDuring her four years at the high commission in London, situated just steps from the bustling city centre of Trafalgar Square, Ms. Mukubwa covered economic, social and consular matters, and was rewarded for her hard work with an accelerated promotion from third secretary to first secretary.\n\nBringing this dedication with her to the mission in Ottawa, Ms. Mukubwa says that in addition to promoting educational ties, she will push for Uganda to receive more aid from Canada.\n\nAlready she says she is encouraged by the many applications for visas that cross her desk coming from Canadian students and young people who want to work in community development in Uganda.\n\n"This is a sign relations are good," she says.

Ms. Finley has pledged the process will be transparent because the instructions will be published on the immigration department''s website and in the <i>Canada Gazette.</i>\r\n\r\nAll of this follows legislative changes to Canada''s immigration process introduced by Ms. Finley earlier this year. The amendment to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was included in the government''s budget implementation bill, Bill C-50. The changes have been the topic of controversy for several months, with many raising alarms the changes grant the minister too much discrepancy over who can, and who can''t, immigrate. \r\n\r\nHowever, despite tall criticisms from opposition MPs during debate in committee hearings and in the House of Commons, the bill passed in Parliament on June 18 and, upon receiving Royal Assent from the Senate, became law. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Finley announced a schedule of consultation sessions to meet with immigration and labour groups, as well as officials from provincial governments, for input on the country''s job-needs.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the types of workers visa officers should be prioritizing will be based on the information collected over the past month of cross-country consultations with more than 200 stakeholders, which included stops in Halifax, St. John''s, Toronto, Edmonton, and Nunavut.\r\n\r\nThe final session was a national roundtable in Ottawa this past Friday where Ms. Finley opened the floor to a question and answer session with participants. This was the only session the minister attended. However, many of her staff, including immigration director general Les Linklater, have been at others.\r\n\r\n"People were quite candid," Ms. Finley said of the meeting. "That was good, they helped us identify some issues we want to explore further."\r\n\r\nWhile Ms. Finley did not name the types of skills she will focus her instructions on, she said the consultations revealed "common threads" in labour shortages across the country. Nearly all regions are facing shortages within their medical, financial and IT sectors, she said.\r\n\r\n"Across the country, our universities and colleges aren''t graduating enough people to fill that demand, especially in the upcoming years," Ms. Finley said. \r\n\r\nAlthough Ms. Finley was optimistic about what had come out of the consultations, many who attended said they felt the discussions were too labour market-oriented and failed to consider other issues, such as the rights of workers, salary levels and most importantly, income disparities among immigrants.\r\n\r\nFurther to this, those who attended say provincial officials consistently voiced concern that the prioritized applicants would overshadow their provincial nominee programs. The nominee programs have become popular in matching immigrants directly with a job opening.\r\n\r\nThe consultations were closed off to members of the media and public, however several participants spoke with <i>Embassy.</i>\r\n\r\nRoberto Jovel, policy and researcher co-ordinator at Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants, who attended a Toronto session in late July, said he felt officials were too focused on "filling holes" and not considering the broader picture.\r\n\r\n"I think that they have not thought through this properly, they''re just listening to the employers, they''re not taking the perspective of immigrants," Mr. Jovel said.\r\n\r\nAt each meeting, immigration officials focused on three central questions: What is the role of immigration in Canada? What are the critical short-term and long-term labour shortages? And what are some issues and barriers to credential recognition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, opposition MPs remain critical of the process, and as Ms. Finley wrapped up consultations in Ottawa, Liberal Immigration critic Maurizio Bevilacqua called the process "flawed" and "completely backwards."\r\n\r\nMr. Bevilacqua, who plans to introduce an alternative immigration policy as part of the Liberal election platform, said the Conservative plan is short-sighted and will not directly deal with the challenges of the immigration system.\r\n\r\n"This Conservative government would rather use stopgap measures to address one of Canada''s greatest economic and population challenges," Mr. Bevilacqua said.\r\n\r\nMr. Bevilacqua also raised concerns that all new applications received since February, when the legislation was introduced, have remained frozen and will not be processed until the instructions are issued.\r\n\r\nThe minister''s instructions apply only to the applications received since Feb. 27. The backlog of about 925,000 applications will be vetted under the old rules, requiring visa officers to process each one.\r\n\r\n<i>mcollins@embassymag.ca</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n', '', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'immigrant-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);INSERT INTO `story` (`story_id`, `story_title`, `story_brief`, `story_content`, `story_kicker`, `story_cutline`, `story_section_id`, `story_section_heading_id`, `story_super_section_id`, `story_front_page`, `story_order`, `story_url_id`, `story_issue_date`, `story_status`, `story_updated`, `story_lock_current_issue`, `story_lock_archives`, `story_hit_view`, `story_hit_email`, `story_hit_blog`) VALUES (5992, '<b>Working Together on Trade, Afghanistan</b>  \n', 'As Quebec City celebrates its 400th anniversary, many Canadians have taken the time to reflect on our country''s history and its connection with our European roots.', 'As Quebec City celebrates its 400th anniversary, many Canadians have taken the time to reflect on our country''s history and its connection with our European roots.  It cannot be overstated the contribution European countries have played in the founding and shaping of this country.  Many hard working men and women came to Canada to seek new opportunities and a new life, bringing with them the best of their traditions from their old countries. We have modeled many of our ideas and institutions on those of Europe and we deeply value the friendship and strong relationships we have with many European countries.\n\nThe NDP believes Canada should seek to build on our historic connections, learning from one another and working together for the betterment of all countries. I would like to take this opportunity to focus on two issues which I believe to be priorities in Canada''s relationship with Europe: International trade and Canada''s involvement with NATO in Afghanistan.\n\n\n<b>International Trade</b>\n\nWith advances in transportation and communications making all corners of the world more accessible, there exists an opportunity for Canada to look for new markets and expand those which we already have in place. With continued expansion of the European common market, bringing more countries under unified trade, labour and environmental standards, the European Union is a major trading partner that Canada cannot and should not overlook.\n\nIn seeking to expand trade opportunities, whether in Europe or around the world, I believe that Canada can look at policies and regulations that have been implemented by the European Union as a model for future trade agreements. One of the many laudable achievements of the EU common market has been its ability to institute strong regulation and common policies across 27 different countries. In doing so, the citizens of Europe now enjoy greater freedom and mobility, more choice in products and higher levels of consumer safety and security.\n\nThe NDP believes that trade between countries should be the tide that raises all boats. It is important that our trading relationship with countries are conducted in a manner that ensures that workers are paid a fair wage and have the safest working conditions possible, that consumer products meet stringent safety regulations, and that industry develops in a sustainable way that treats the environment with respect and not simply as a resource to be consumed.\n\nThe environmental component of any future trade agreement will be of major significance, especially as we balance the needs of industry with the obligation to reduce the causes of climate change. Along with creating green-collar jobs to help us clean up our environment and measure the needs and gaps in the new energy economy, I believe the best way to achieve this balance is by putting a price on carbon.\n\nThe NDP is currently the only party in Canada that has a comprehensive program to make polluters pay through a cap-and-trade system that will produce real results in curbing the production of greenhouse gases. We know this is the most effective way today to combat climate change. Canadians are encouraged by the improvements made to the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and we have learned from Europe''s experiences to ensure our polluter pay cap-and-trade system does not have to endure the same type of growing pains.\n\nWhile we establish a system for pricing carbon in Canada, we also need to address the impact this has on international trade. The NDP is committed to trade policies based on the protection of environmental and labour standards. We simply cannot let an uneven playing field develop where cheap imported goods, made in ways that violate basic environmental or labour standards, unfairly compete with made-in-Canada goods. We will need to put effective mechanisms in place to protect Canadian jobs and environmental standards.\n\n\n <b>Afghanistan</b>\n\nCanada is currently standing shoulder-to-shoulder with numerous European countries in Afghanistan as part of NATO''s International Security Assistance Force.  We are proud of the contribution and sacrifices that our soldiers and those of our allies have made to the country, but are keenly aware of the problems that continue to exist. Over the past year we have seen the progress achieved in Afghanistan begin to slide back as Taliban forces have stepped up attacks and the trade in opium has become even more predominant.\n\nI believe, as do many Canadians, that we have come to a critical juncture in the Afghanistan mission and there must be an honest re-evaluation of NATO''s current role.  This discussion began at the NATO Summit in Bucharest and must be allowed to continue despite pressure from certain member countries to stay the course.\n\nIt is the position of the New Democratic Party that the current focus of counter-insurgency operations has not and will not lead to greater peace and stability in the country. While we cannot discount the need for security, it is imperative that NATO and the international community engage in diplomatic and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan with the same focus and vigour.\n\nTherefore, we are calling for the withdrawal of troops from counter-insurgency missions and a renewed focus on diplomacy, both within Afghanistan and with neighbouring states, and an increase in aid and development.\n\nAs part of our re-think on Afghanistan, serious consideration should be given to bringing the current ISAF operations under the full mandate of the United Nations. International terrorism and the future of Afghanistan are not the concern of Western countries alone; accordingly achieving peace in Afghanistan will take the involvement of the global community. The United Nations, through its agencies such as the UNDP, the WHO and the UN Peace-building Commission, is better able to meet the various challenges that exist and will ensure the greatest hope for success in Afghanistan.\n\nAs Canada and Europe move forward into the future, I am confident that we will be able to work in harmony to better our countries, address the global concerns that affect all of us, and strengthen the ties that bind us together as friends.  \n\n<i>Paul Dewar is the New Democratic Party''s foreign affairs critic.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'dewar-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5993, '<b> Afghan SAT Successor to Have Fewer Staff </b>  \n', '', 'With a budget of $12.2 million to spend over the next five years, the newly established Canadian Governance Support Office in Kabul will provide fewer advisors to the Afghan government than its predecessor, the controversial Strategic Advisory Team. \n\n<div id="sidebar" style="width: 200px;"> <b>The CGSO''s Main Man</b>\n\nDays after the Governance Support Office was established in July, CANADEM dispatched to Afghanistan the man who will quarterback Canada''s new capacity building program: Grant Brown.\n\nMr. Brown has behind him an impressive career with more than 30 years management experience in developed, developing and post-conflict countries. He has worked for CIDA, has served as an officer in the Canadian Navy, and has worked on projects in a wide variety of fields, including telecommunications, construction, mining, agriculture, education and banking\n\nA native of Kitchener, Ont., Mr. Grant has served in a number of foreign destinations, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Colombia, India, Nepal and Thailand.\n\nUntil mid-2007, Mr. Grant was working for the American embassy in Baghdad and oversaw all American reconstruction and capacity building programs in Iraq. \n\n\n<b>CANADEM at a Glance </b>\n\nCANADEM, a brainchild of Paul LaRose-Edwards, was founded as a way to connect Canadian workers with international skillsets to employers that need them.\n\nFounded in 1996, CANADEM''s centerpiece is a roster of more than 10,000 Canadians with international experience who are willing to be deployed on short notice to various world hotspots. CANADEM registrants boast specialized skillsets in such fields as human rights, counter-trafficking, security and policing, child protection, water and sanitation, humanitarian aid and governance. \n\nSome 65 different languages are spoken by the workers listed on CANADEM''s roster.\n\nA not-for-proft NGO funded by the Canadian government, CANADEM has placed more than 2,500 experts in UN agencies, multilateral organizations, national governments, NGOs and private businesses in more than 70 countries.\n\nCANADEM, whose offices are located at offices on Nicolas Street in Ottawa, has also dispatched over 1,200 election observers to Ukraine, Serbia, across South America and elsewhere.\n\nMore than 450 CANADEM registrants have worked in Afghanistan since 2002 under various organizations. Prior to the foundation of the Governance Support Office, CANADEM received $2.5 million in grants to send Canadians to Afghanistan to work in fields including police reform, justice reform, election observation, and civil-military relations. </div>According to Paul LaRose-Edwards, executive director of CANADEM, the Canadian NGO selected by the Canadian International Development Agency to administer the office, current funding levels are only enough to maintain a constant staff of seven or eight civilian advisors.\n\nThe Governance Support Office, which was established in July, aims to build the capacity of Afghanistan''s ministries and governmental agencies. To do this, it will embed civilians with expertise in fields such as education within the ministries themselves for extended periods.\n\nThe office will replace the Strategic Advisory Team, a team of Canadian military officers that has been attached to various Afghan ministries since 2005. The SAT, a creation of former chief of defence staff Rick Hillier, will be formally disbanded at the end of August.\n\nAccording to a DND spokesman, the SAT had a total of 14 Canadian soldiers on its staff when it closed. Of these, three were at the SAT''s head office in Kabul while 11 were posted within Afghan ministries. The SAT''s budget was $1.33 million in fiscal year 2006-07, and $1.5 in 2007-08.\n\nLast week, government officials told <i>Embassy</i> the changeover "reflects that we are balancing away from a largely military to more of a civilian mission."\n\nMr. LaRose-Edwards said the Governance Support Office idea got off the ground when he submitted an unsolicited proposal to CIDA in April 2007. His initial request for $98 million over five years, he said, would have allowed CANADEM to staff the office with about 20 to 25 civilian experts for a period of five years.\n\nThis initial proposal was rejected.\n\nMr. LaRose-Edwards then submitted another proposal for $20 million over five years. When the final agreement was signed in July 2008, the program was given a budget of $12.2 million for five years.\n\nHowever, Mr. LaRose-Edwards said, additional funding could eventually come down the pipe.\n\nHe said the Governance Support Office has a contribution agreement which allows for other parts of the government to contribute to the project. \n\n"I suspect, and we''re already getting an indication, that Foreign Affairs has money and other parts of CIDA have money, and they''re going to use the CGSO platform," to dispatch additional experts to key ministries, he said.  \n\n"There''s an expectation by a lot of people if it turns out well, and every indication is that it''s going to turn out well, there will be more resources," he said. \n\nWhile Mr. LaRose-Edwards said he does not know how much additional funding the office could receive, he remains confident it can handle a wider scope of operations than is currently planned.  \n\n"Can we handle $100 million? Yeah, we can handle a lot more than that," he said.\n\nAfghan agencies that will likely receive civilian advisors from the Governance Support Office include the Ministry of Education, the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation and Development and the Independent Electoral Commission. In addition, two Governance Support Office consultants will be assigned to work on Canada''s signature project: the refurbishment of the Dahla irrigation dam on Kandahar Province''s Arghandab river.\n\nThe office''s staff will be drawn from CANADEM''s roster of more than 10,000 civilian experts willing to work in challenging international posts. \n\nMr. LaRose-Edwards said annual salaries upwards of $150,000 are often necessary to convince civilian development specialists to accept the risks of working in a warzone.\n\nWhile welcoming the transfer of capacity building responsibilities from the military to civilians, opposition critics doubted whether a budget of $12 million will be enough to make a difference.\n\n"We''ve always said the mission is really unbalanced," said Bloc Qu&eacute;becois Defence critic Claude Bachand. "More civilians, more diplomacy, more development, more counseling...I favour that rather than investing millions and millions in more soldiers and military equipment."\n\nHowever, he said, "A $12-million bill is not very much."\n\nNDP Foreign Affairs critic Paul Dewar accused the government of "trying to redefine the mission on the cheap."\n\nWhile the government has stated its intention to rebalance the mission towards more development and reconstruction, he said, more will be needed to make a real impact. \n\n"I don''t see how they can rebalance the mission, if that''s their intention, with seven or eight people embedded within the Afghan bureaucracy," Mr. Dewar said. "I think what it requires is a very significant human resources influx, not just seven or eight people.\n\n"If we believe the solution cannot be a military solution, if it has to be development and diplomacy, then they have to be putting money where their mouth is," he added.\n\nLiberal International Development critic Keith Martin said the government has not clearly articulated why the Governance Support Office was established, nor what it hopes to achieve.\n\n\n<b>''A Lot of Brave Souls''</b>\n\nThe Governance Support Office is being established amidst a worsening security situation in Afghanistan.\n\nJust last week, two Canadian aid workers working for an NGO called the International Rescue Committee, Jackie Kirk and Shirley Case, were gunned down in a Taliban ambush in the Eastern province of Logar. \n\nThis attack, perhaps unsurprisingly, comes just two weeks after a report by the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief (ACBAR) spoke to the sharp increase of attacks on international aid workers this year\n\n"Aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks, threats and intimidation, by both insurgent and criminal groups," the report said. "So far this year, 19 NGO staff have been killed, which already exceeds the total number of NGO workers killed last year."\n\nMr. LaRose-Edwards has no delusions about the security risk of sending aid workers into unstable countries.  In 2005, a CANADEM policing expert, retired RCMP officer Mark Bourque, was killed in Haiti in an unprovoked attack.\n\n"There''s always a chance someone will get killed," he said.\n\nMr. LaRose-Edwards said the Governance Support Office will take steps to protect its staff. The staff will live together in a compound guarded by private security contractors similar to those that protect the Canadian Embassy in Kabul. \n\nIn addition, he said, competent drivers and some armoured vehicles will be purchased to help protect civilian experts while on the move. \n\nIn the event a worker is killed, $750,000 in insurance money will go to the family of the deceased, he said. \n\nMr. LaRose-Edwards said the biggest guarantor of security will be recruiting civilian experts who have plenty of experience working in hostile environments and an eye for personal safety.\n\nFor example, the office''s chief, Grant Brown, has extensive experience in Iraq. Meanwhile, the two men who will work on the Dahla Dam are of Afghan heritage and have years of experience working in Pakistan and Bangladesh. \n\n"One of biggest mitigating measures is to make sure we''ve got the right expert that understands what''s going on around them," he said. \n\nPlus, he said, the folks being hired to staff the Governance Support Office are more than willing to shoulder the risks inherent to life in Afghanistan.\n\n"Yes it''s dangerous, but at the same time we have a lot of individuals who want to take these risks, that are bound and determined to assist Afghanistan to move things forward," he said. They''re saying to us, ''We want you to let us take these risks.''...They are a lot of brave souls."\n\n<i>jdavis@embassymag.ca </i>\n\n\n\n\n', 'The Strategic Advisory Team employed more people with less money, yet critics say the government is doing development on the cheap.\n', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'afghan_sat-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0),(5994, '<b> Canada Turning Away Afghan Asylum Seekers </b>  \n', '', '<b>By Michelle Collins</b>\n\n\nDespite repeated statements that progress is being made in Afghanistan, thousands of Afghans are actively trying to flee to the safety of countries abroad, including Canada. \n\nBut it appears that Afghans seeking asylum in Canada stand a better chance of being granted refuge if they can make their way onto Canadian soil rather than apply at visa offices overseas, according to figures obtained by <i>Embassy.</i>\n\nIn 2007, the Canadian visa post in Islambad approved 34.5 per cent of applicants under the privately sponsored refugee class, whereas the Immigration and Refugee Board in Canada approved 69 per cent of applications received.\n\nExperts and immigration lawyers in Canada say the low approval rates of applications in Islamabad is indicative of a widespread problem of poor training and decision-making that they say has been plaguing Canadian visa offices abroad for years&mdash;and why the immigration department has launched an internal review of its processes, called a Quality Assurance project.\n\nExecutive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees Janet Dench said refugee advocates have been asking the government to address the problems at visa offices overseas for a long time. \n\nThe 34.5 per cent approval rate in Islamabad is a significant drop from the 59 per cent of applications approved in 2005 and 2006, while approvals at the Refugee Board are also down from 82 per cent in 2006, and 74 per cent in 2005.\n\n"A lot of the way visa office decision making on refugees goes is there seems to be a kind of trend that goes on in decision making," Ms. Dench said, of why the approval rates may have dropped in 2007. "The impression we get often is they kind of make generalizations or they make general decisions about what we''re going to say about the situation in the country of origin, and they''re quite influenced about what the UNHCR might say." \n\nAs Afghanistan is on an apparent path of recovery, the UN Refugee Agency, or UNHCR, has focused on encouraging Afghans&mdash;the largest group of people of concern to the organization today&mdash;to return to Afghanistan.\n\nUNHCR''s representative in Canada, Abraham Abraham, said an average of 1,100 to 1,200 people are returning to Afghanistan every day, while resettlement to another country, such as Canada, is a tool of last resort.\n\n"We are seeing a trend toward voluntary repatriation to Afghanistan, it is a positive thing, it has been going on several years and UNHCR has been supporting it," Mr. Abraham said. "It signals that there are places in Afghanistan that people are able to go back to; the vast majority of the people returning are from frontier provinces, Pakistan." \n\nBut executive director of the Afghan Women''s Organization in Toronto, Adeena Niazi, said the improvements taking place across Afghanistan have done little to change human rights and she insists men and women are still at risk of persecution.\n\nSince 2001, an estimated five million Afghan refugees have returned, with still more than three million Afghans outside its borders; approximately one million in Iran and almost two million in Pakistan. \n\n"We get lots of calls from overseas, but also from friends and families here in Canada, but we don''t have the capacity, and also the acceptance rate is low. The rate has dropped down because some of the reports coming from the government trying to paint a rosy picture of Afghanistan," Ms. Niazi said. "If it is essential for our troops to be there, there is a need."\n\nIn recent months, there has been an increase in reports of Afghans fleeing the violence spreading across southern provinces and heading for Kabul. This past Saturday, the Hamilton, Ont.-based Pashtun Peace Forum called on the international community, including Canada, to provide immigration and refugee status to people displaced in the region on a priority basis to "save innocent Pashtun people from the war-drama between Al-Qaida and Pakistani military agencies."\n\n\n<b>Visa Office Problems</b>\n\nPaulette Johnson, program co-ordinator for the refugee sponsorship program at the Catholic Social Services in Edmonton, said she has long been concerned that refugee applicants overseas do not receive the quality of review they are given in Canada. A recent review of the refusals to some of her own cases for Sudanese refugee applicants revealed a similar pattern where several cases were rejected, yet the applicant could not safely return.  \n\n"I take a big sigh because it''s been a really very long standing frustration we''ve had that we do not feel that the review or assessment that a refugee has, or receives overseas, is equivalent to or as consistent as what they might get in Canada," Ms. Johnson said. \n\nThe immigration department''s review, said spokeswoman Karen Shadd, is evaluating the decisions made for approximately 240 of the applications (about 10 per cent) ruled on at visa offices in the Africa/Middle East region to determine whether decisions are in line with the laws, regulations and policy.\n\nThe reviews are focusing on decisions of both approved and refused cases from seven overseas missions, in Accra, Abidjan, Abu Dhabi, Cairo, Damascus, Nairobi and Pretoria. The Islamabad office is not part of the review.\n\n"Through this project we hope to obtain information that will help improve the quality, transparency and consistency in making and communicating decisions, identify any visa officer training gaps, develop working tools for visa officers and make recommendations with respect to ongoing [quality assurance] monitoring of the program," Ms. Shadd said. The report is due sometime in the fall.\n\nToronto immigration lawyer Andrew Brouwer said the low acceptance rates coming out of Islamabad fit the pattern he has observed over the last several years wherein the decisions have little to do with the actual situation on the ground. \n\n"There''s been a really disturbing pattern of poor decision making," Mr. Brouwer said. "Every single case where I''ve begun litigation on a refusal, the government has recognized the problem before going to court." \n\nMr. Brouwer said the low acceptance rate in Islamabad is particularly worrisome because Afghanistan is one of eight countries for which Canada has a moratorium on removals because of the level of insecurity there. Other countries for which Canada has a moratorium on removals are Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Iraq, Liberia, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe. \n\n<i>mcollins@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', 'Despite a deteriorating security situation, the Canadian visa office in Islamabad is getting more restrictive on who it lets into the country, in contrast to the IRB.\n', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'asylum_seekers-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0),(5995, '<b> Navy Tries to Bolster Pakistan''s Failing War on Heroin Smugglers </b>  \n', '', 'A Canadian warship dropped anchor in Pakistan for the first time this month to mount a bilateral naval exercise aimed at helping stem the flow of drugs that ooze out of Afghanistan and fund the Taliban insurgency.\n\nFrom Aug. 6-8, the destroyer HMCS Iroquois, under the command of Commodore Bob Davidson, was anchored off Karachi, Pakistan''s largest city and a major shipping port.\n\n"It was the first Canadian warship visit to Pakistan since the nation''s founding in 1947," Commodore Davidson said in a telephone interview last week. "It was a pretty big deal from a Pakistani perspective. They felt it was pretty important we were there."\n\nDuring the visit, the Canadian ship participated in a one-day exercise with the Pakistani Navy and the Pakistani Maritime Security Agency, a coast guard-like agency. \n\nThe exercise was aimed at bolstering Pakistani efforts to intercept drugs flowing from Afghanistan, through the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan, and out to sea.\n\n"A lot of that drug smuggling comes down through Baluchistan and goes on to the water where it''s shipped," Commodore Davidson said.\n\nHe said Pakistani officials were frank about their losing battle with drug smugglers.\n\n"They''ll be the first to admit they cannot stop the drug trade," he said. "They''ll be the first to admit they have challenges in managing the western [Pakistani] areas where the Taliban is located."\n\nThe Iroquois is in the region as part of a multinational, non-NATO naval fleet called Combined Task Force 150. The task group was formed after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 and is part of the larger U.S.-led global War on Terrorism. \n\nCommodore Davidson currently commands the entire 14-ship fleet, consisting of ships from France, Germany, Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Canada currently contributes three ships, while a fourth is in the area escorting World Food Program ships delivering supplies to Somalia.\n\nThe task force has logistics facilities in Djibouti and patrols strategically important areas such as the Red Sea, the Arabian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman. The task force aims to disrupt terror networks and provide security in an area plagued by piracy and terrorism.\n\nCommodore Davidson said Pakistan is not alone in trying to stop the flow of drugs from Afghanistan.\n\nHe said CTF 150 has had some considerable success in nabbing shipments of Afghan hashish that are leaving via Pakistan''s Arabian Sea coast on its way to Europe and beyond. In the past six months, Commodore Davidson said, coalition ships have intercepted some 30 tons of the condensed marijuana product.  \n\n"We do tackle some of the drug shipments to try and break supply chain and effect the funding," he said. "If we can stop the trade in hashish that comes out of Afghanistan, that''s eventually going to hurt the Taliban."\n\nLess luck, he said, has been had intercepting more valuable heroin shipments. \n\nBut it wasn''t all sailing and searching during the visit to Karachi.\n\nThe Iroquois, in co-ordination with the Canadian embassy, threw a number of luncheons and receptions for the Pakistani political and military classes. \n\nA reception the first evening, he said, attracted a "mixed bag" of dignitaries, including some senior ministers of the federal government, senior military brass, provincial politicians, Karachi city officials and officials from various political parties.\n\n"With what''s going on in Afghanistan, it''s important for Canada to have some ties in Pakistan as well," Commodore Davidson remarked.\n\n\n<b>A Flood of Heroin</b>\n\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime''s Afghanistan Opium Survey 2007, 93 per cent of the opiates on the world market originated in Afghanistan. The total export value of opiates produced in and trafficked from Afghanistan in 2007 was about $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006.\n\nAt a news conference in November, the UNODC''s executive director Antonio Maria Costa, said monies raised from the estimated 660 tons of heroin produced in Afghanistan fund the Taliban.\n\n"The potential windfall for criminals, insurgents and terrorists is staggering and runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars" the UN drug czar said. "Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys. Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban''s main funding source."\n\nAlmas Bawar is Canada''s country director for the Senlis Council, an NGO that studies the drug trade in Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Bawar said heroin is smuggled out of Afghanistan through Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Pakistan. While Iranian authorities have been cracking down on smugglers, he said, moving drugs through Pakistan''s lawless tribal areas is "very easy."\n\nMost opium is processed into more potent heroin for export, he said, and then packed onto horses or donkeys before it is walked through mountain passes. \n\n"In [Pakistan''s] tribal areas, where there is no government, you can freely travel," he said. "Baluchistan is the same thing again, and you can continue up to the ocean. It''s easy to smuggle anything."\n\nMr. Bawar said the Pakistani government, with weak control of its border zones, is impotent in the face of the smugglers.\n\n"If they''re not capable of controlling tribal areas, how do you think they will stop the trafficking?" he said.\n\nEminent Pakistani journalist and Afghanistan expert Ahmed Rashid said corruption amongst Pakistani officials is a major facilitator for drug smugglers. \n\n"Like in Afghanistan, a lot of the traffickers in Baluchistan are very well connected to senior officials, so there''s a lot of complicity there," he said in a phone interview Monday.\n\nThe Pakistani High Commission in Ottawa refused to speak about its counter-narcotics efforts.\n\n<i>jdavis@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'The HMCS Iroquois was in Pakistan this month to help stem the flow of drugs coming from Afghanistan.

The total cost over 10 years to March 31, 2008 was $66 million.\n\nHowever, despite positive reviews from Canadian and foreign organizations, as well as recipient countries, the Conservative government decided in March 2008 to extend the program for one year pending a review, rather than renew it for a longer period of time.\n\nCIDA officials did not respond to questions over the past week about the status of the program, but CIDA officials have been working on a five-year submission to the Treasury Board (Human Resources and Social Development Canada must also complete a submission as the lead department). Sources say the submission is not yet finished.\n\nWhile funding for this year''s round of 400 or so interns, who are already working overseas, ends on March 31, 2009, organizations begin the planning process for placing interns in the early fall, meaning they are all anxiously awaiting word of its future.\n\nIn the past, the aid agency has called on Canadian organizations to make proposals for internship placements and funding around the end of September, and sources say the agency plans to follow suit this year. However, a caveat is expected to be attached stating that funding will be conditional upon approval of an extension or a new five-year program. An election would compound problems further unless a decision is made first.\n\n\n<b>Students, Gov''t Would Lose Out</b>\n\nGuyana''s high commissioner to Ottawa, Rajnarine Singh, said his country hasn''t received as many interns lately as in previous years, but "obviously they would have been doing some good work in Guyana because they would have been taking Canadian experience and Canadian exposure into the respective countries.\n\n"Those would be new experiences that they would be imparting," he said. "So on the overall basis, our countries would benefit to some extent with the presence of those individuals."\n\nMr. Singh said he was confident the government, if it cancelled the CIDA internship program, would replace it with something else as the aid agency is currently re-evaluating all of its programs in the Caribbean. Whether a new program would mark an improvement or not would depend on the program itself, he said.\n\nIn some corners of the world, there has emerged a debate over whether internship programs are as beneficial to developing countries as originally envisioned, with the argument that retirees would make more of a contribution given their real-life experience.\n\nMr. Singh agreed that retirees would be more helpful, but he was quick to note that internships benefit both recipient countries and Canada.\n\n"Obviously the more experienced person would be helpful to us, but from the students'' point of view," he said, "it would be advantageous to them because it would give them greater exposure and immediately put into practice what they have learned in school. So from that point of view, the student would lose out."\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by Erin Mackie, a University of Saskatchewan graduate who credits her experience as a CIDA intern in Ghana in 2000 for helping her break into the field of development.\n\nMs. Mackie spent six months travelling around Ghana teaching credit agencies and unions about gender issues in an effort to promote women''s rights, though she had to be flexible.\n\n"Because a lot of the organizations you''re working with, they''re strapped for human resources, so they can really make good use of an intern and they''re more than happy to have a young Canadian around," she said.\n\n"That being said, you also have to take the initiative and figure out where you can fit in and where you can help. Even though I was there to do gender work, I ended up doing a needs assessment for the financial sector. So you have these opportunities that just kind of come to you that you wouldn''t get in a lot of other positions."\n\nThe experience not only convinced Ms. Mackie, who is now the senior program manager for Asia and Eastern Europe at the Canadian Co-operative Association, to continue working in international development, it helped her break into the sector.\n\n"It''s so difficult to get into this industry and work in international development without having that opportunity," she said. "And it''s getting even more competitive now and the need for internships is greater, not less, than what it used to be."\n\nMs. Mackie said it would be "short-sighted" if the government were to cancel the CIDA internship program because of the effect it has abroad and in Canada.\n\n"They talk about Canadian engagement, this is one of the best ways to do it."\n\nLiberal CIDA critic Keith Martin said cancelling the aid agency''s internship program would represent a blow to CIDA''s future.\n\n"This is a breeding ground for CIDA workers and it allows young people to get the experience they desperately need in order to get employment in international development," he said. "This program is for developing countries, and it''s also for Canada, to enable us to exercise our abilities to help other countries help themselves."\n\nMr. Martin said he was deeply concerned about the program''s fate.\n\n"If [the government] were interested in the program, they would have renewed it by now and given it a longer mandate," he said.\n\n"This government, the Conservative government, has cut a number of programs that have helped young people and enabled youth to get experience in areas of employment, and in a time of surplus, these are not the areas to cut. You don''t cut the human infrastructure abilities of our country, and that''s what this government has been doing."\n\n\n<b>Program Effective, Accountable</b>\n\nIn the fall of 2006, the government announced a $13.2-billion surplus at the same time it was cutting a number of different internship programs, including DFAIT''s Young Professionals International internship program.\n\nJust that spring, the Foreign Affairs department had evaluated the program and found: "There is a need for a Program like YPI to provide international work experience and employability skills that youth require to enter employment, which they would normally have difficulty obtaining."\n\nThe evaluation went on to state that the program "has been successful in positively impacting on participants and DFAIT" and that "after their placements, a majority of participants have the skills targeted by the Program and are employed up to two years following completion."\n\nWhile the evaluation said it could not tell to what degree the participants remained employed, it said the program "is reaping benefits for the Department as well by helping the Department meet its priorities and by strengthening ties."\n\nLike the CIDA program, each DFAIT intern placement cost $15,000, though $12,000 had to be spent directly on the participant, with host organizations only allowed to take $3,000 for administration costs.\n\nDespite this glowing review, the government cancelled the program in September 2006 in a move Al Cook, director of both the DFAIT and CIDA internship programs at the Canadian Bar Association, described as "one of the great acts of political vandalism."\n\n"The program was building Canada''s image of human rights and constructive engagement with the rest of the world," he said. "It was really raising the Canadian flag very high for a very minimal cost."\n\nBut even more important&mdash;and this Mr. Cook says is the true barometre of its success&mdash;was the large percentage of participants who got jobs afterwards.\n\nLucien Bradet, president of the Canadian Council of Africa, which has had CIDA interns in the past, said the program is extremely cost-effective and accountable.\n\n"It''s a very inexpensive program," he said. "I have not yet seen in this program any abuse or any mishaps."\n\nMaria Schnurr, who runs internship programs at Ottawa''s Algonquin College, said if the government is going to make a decision on whether to renew the program or not, it must decide soon as Canadian and international organizations build it into their yearly work plans.\n\n"A decision has to be made by Treasury Board pretty shortly for things to roll out as they do," she said.\n\n<i>lee@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', 'Advocates say the program is cost-effective and of great benefit to Canadian youth who need overseas experience.

In this troubled environment, the states of the European Union have proceeded in a manner resembling the blunders commemorated at another time in Lord Tennyson''s poem, The Charge of the Light Brigade.  \n\nThe European nations'' involvement is shaped by their participation in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force operation. Though 25 of 27 European Union nations are engaged in the mission, the reality is that only a few European states have significant numbers of troops in Afghanistan and even fewer (two to be exact, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands) are in the main combat zone in the south, even after the much heralded French deployment into the east of the country. No wonder some laugh that ISAF actually stands for I Saw Americans Fight.\n\nEuropean engagement is circumscribed by caveats and conditions on the location and role of deployments. These are meant to placate restive domestic audiences who fail to see the value of the mission. But the caveats are not simply the result of cowardice or craven caving to populist pacifism. They are the product of strategic and diplomatic calculation. Hesitations over NATO''s first combat mission outside Europe highlight the fact that the vision of global NATO has never been a unanimous position of the member states.\n\nOnly the member states who share the American vision of NATO as a global security actor have deployed to fight the Taliban-led insurgency in the south. Both the so-called Old and New Europe have doubts about the global agenda.\n\nOld Europe is largely happy to reserve NATO as the guarantor of European security through the provision of territorial defence.\n\nMeanwhile, New Europe, not long liberated from Soviet clutches, still fears Russian interference and prefers NATO''s anti-Russian focus be maintained. Given recent developments in Georgia, who can blame them?\n\nAll the while, as Afghanistan has increasingly negative connotations among European publics comparing it to the fighting in Iraq, for European leaders a major distraction has been Kosovo, a simmering crisis seen as in the EU''s backyard rather than far from home. \n\nEuropean policy is plagued by jurisdictional jealousies: some prefer more EU and less NATO, others the member states rather than an EU mission, and still others the Big Four leading policy. Even the EU''s collective intervention is shaped by its internal schisms.\n\nWhile the Commission allocates billions of euros to a variety of development, humanitarian and other rebuilding projects, its mandate in the provision of non-military aspects of security assistance overlaps with the role of the Council''s High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. The EU''s special representative in Afghanistan is supposed to bring cohesion to all this and in effect provide "one-stop shopping" regarding EU policies.\n\nThis is a tall order for recently appointed, Ettore Francesco Sequi, an Italian diplomat. The failed EU Constitution and its successor, the Reform Treaty, were supposed to rationalize the EU''s foreign policy instruments and decision-making.\n\nDon''t hold your breath. \n\nWhere bold moves have indeed been taken by the Europeans, such as attempts to bring warring factions together, they have been rebuffed by the Afghan government (and EU diplomats expelled from the country) or have run afoul of contradictory policies preferred by the United States, for instance, over whether to legalize or destroy local poppy cultivation. The steady&mdash;a cynic might say glacial&mdash;development of the European security and defence policy has been given a fillip with EUPOL as it trains Afghan police as part of its civilian crisis management dimension.\n\nBut this project depends on the preservation of a security environment and an uncorrupted culture of governance in which these police and justice officials can go about their business. \n\nBut the ultimate conundrum in Afghanistan is the mismatch of the intervention with its goal. The European engagement is a charge of the Lite Brigade because it follows the pattern outlined in Michael Ignatieff''s polemic Empire Lite.\n\nUnlike military engagements and imperial conquests of the past, today''s interventions are conducted in the long shadow of mass democracy. This means that deployments need to be justified at home, defended before a domestic audience. It also means that the "host" or target state is to be rendered democratic in some way, despite the fact that this is achieved paradoxically through the instrument of alien military force. The EU''s involvement maps on to Ignatieff''s critique of post-cold war peacekeeping and peace enforcement as imperial ventures in disguise, as was the case in the trusteeship over Kosovo.\n\nToday''s interventions are not about conquest as an end in itself, but as a means to another end (democracy) through short-term, low-level military engagement.\n\nAs a consequence, what is at stake is not military victory or defeat. To neutralize Afghanistan as a potential future threat to the West is to stabilize it by irreversibly changing it. This is a politico-strategic outcome rather than a military one, achievable only over the course of generations. The EU''s Lite Brigade intervention can only be miniscule and temporary by comparison. \n\nSo where was the strategic calculation regarding the EU''s intervention in Afghanistan? And what sort of government bleats to its allies that it needs help in a region that it deliberately chose to engage in?\n\nThe marked lack of strategic wisdom is a result of hubris and an interventionist culture that is prevalent across the Western world. In essence, interventionism is the unexamined belief that some action on our part is better than none, even in affairs we don''t understand, in regions where we don''t have reach and our interests are unclear, and in conflicts that any realistic assessment would indicate are unlikely to be remedied given the resources available for an international military intervention.\n\n<i>David Long is a professor at Carleton''s University''s Norman Paterson School of International Affairs and a researcher at with the strategic knowledge cluster Canada-Europe Transatlantic Dialogue.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'long-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);INSERT INTO `story` (`story_id`, `story_title`, `story_brief`, `story_content`, `story_kicker`, `story_cutline`, `story_section_id`, `story_section_heading_id`, `story_super_section_id`, `story_front_page`, `story_order`, `story_url_id`, `story_issue_date`, `story_status`, `story_updated`, `story_lock_current_issue`, `story_lock_archives`, `story_hit_view`, `story_hit_email`, `story_hit_blog`) VALUES (5998, '<b>Fortier: ''We''re Trying to Cast a Very Wide Net''</b>  \n', 'When the Conservative government unveiled its foreign policy priorities last year, the short list identified Afghanistan, the Americas and emerging economies like India and China as the areas of paramount interest to Canada.', 'When the Conservative government unveiled its foreign policy priorities last year, the short list identified Afghanistan, the Americas and emerging economies like India and China as the areas of paramount interest to Canada.\n\nConspicuously absent from the list was any mention of Europe, a move experts say is unsurprising given a noticeable lack of interest in the continent despite the fact the European Union is Canada''s second-largest trading partner, and changes in Russia and Eastern Europe were opening up new opportunities for Canadian business.\n\nThe government''s decision last March to close consulates general in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Milan, Italy, as well as the shuffling of trade commissioners away from the region in favour of Latin America and, particularly, Asia elicited strong reactions and accusations the government was ignoring the continent.\n\nAnd yet over the past year or so, there have emerged signs the Conservative government is starting to come around on Europe.

The following an edited transcript of that discussion:\n\n\n<b>Europe isn''t listed as one of the top priority for this government. We have Afghanistan, the Americas and the emerging economies of Asia, particularly India and China. Where exactly does Europe fit into the government''s plans and priorities?</b>\n\n"As a matter of fact, it is a priority for the government. As you know, in the upcoming Canada-EU summit in Montreal in October, we will be discussing with the EU closer economic ties, a closer economic partnership with them and that results from the last Canada-EU summit that took place in June of 2007 in Germany. It''s our second largest export economic market. Foreign direct investment into Canada is around 24, 25 per cent.\n\n"So no, Europe is a priority for us, there''s no doubt about it.... The Global Commerce Strategy talks about the Americas and talks about Canada and India, but it''s not exclusive of other markets. As a matter of fact, Europe is one of our 13 priority markets around the world."\n\n\n<b>There''s a lot of talk about this pending Canada-EU summit and the economic framework agreement. It sounds like everyone is hoping something will happen. There has been a feasibility study conducted and I''m wondering what the results of that were.</b>\n\n"The studies are not yet completed. Once they are completed, this actually is one of the discussion items I will be having with [EU Trade Commissioner] Peter Mandelson during the summit; basically taking stock of the studies and deciding where we go from there."\n\n\n<b>At this point, does the government have any clear idea on what exactly closer economic ties would entail?</b>\n\n"We want to cast as wide a net as possible. I mean that''s where I start from, and obviously this exercise began before I showed up, but that''s how it was cast. And so the studies in terms of the topics they are addressing, demonstrate the fact that both ourselves and the EU are trying to cast a very wide net. And so we''ll have to see what the studies come up with, and then see where we direct our efforts. But hopefully this will be a very broad effort towards a broad and encompassing agreement."\n\n\n<b>There is a lot of talk about the "deliverables," and one of those, of course, is getting all of the provinces on board because there''s talk about labour mobility and other issues that are provincial responsibilities.  Do you get a sense the provinces are on board and are there more things the federal government can and should be doing to make sure there''s unanimous consensus on the importance of this?</b>\n\n"The provinces are aware of this initiative and my understanding is that during the last Council of the Federation, which took place this summer, that this was discussed and that the provinces agree with the direction the federal government is taking this initiative.\n\n"That being said, the provinces are also aware that, for example, provincial procurement has been raised by not just the EU but by prior partners in the past and I''m encouraged by the fact that Dalton McGuinty and Jean Charest...signed a joint declaration which called for closer economic relationship between us and the EU, and specifically addressed the fact that the provinces would be co-operating with the federal government in all areas possible.\n\n"So that tells me that the provinces are aware that they will need to participate fully in terms of the deliverables, and I''ll give you one example: procurement is one where we''re hoping the provinces will be able to meet the EU''s expectations."\n\n\n<b>Is there anything that the federal government is doing to facilitate that, or can do?</b>\n\n"Under our Constitution, some of these matters are of the exclusive domain of the provinces. But we want a robust agreement with the EU, and I believe so do the provinces, and hence they will need, in some areas, to show flexibility, and I believe they will.\n\n\n<b>There''s been some lack of interest by some members in the EU. Does the government have a plan to drive the issue further up on their agendas or get more attention for it?</b>\n\n"I don''t sense that. As you know France holds the presidency and President [Nicolas] Sarkozy will be here during the summit. In my talks with Peter Mandelson when I was in Geneva with him for these most recent WTO negotiations, I sensed that the EU, as Canada, is anxious to get the results of these studies. I also met several of my EU counterparts who were in Geneva and I sensed from them that they are looking forward to talks with Canada.\n\n"And so I get a sense that the EU is looking forward to getting this on the road and believes Canada is probably a good partner to be looking at these types of issues with because of the type of economy we have and also because of the close economic ties we already have with several countries that form part of the EU."\n\n\n<b>The consulate-general in Russia was closed [last year] and that elicited strong responses from Russian authorities. What is the vision when it comes to commercial relations with Russia at this point in time?</b>\n\n"Our vision is that we need to build closer economic ties and, more importantly, to build the environment in which our Canadian companies, our exporters can do business in Russia and thrive in Russia.\n\n"We''ve announced this summer that we''d be deploying new trade commissioners to Kiev and Moscow. Russia is an important market for Canadian exporters and part of my job is to facilitate their business dealings for Canadian exporters around the world, and Russia is a market that is very attractive for Canadian companies and so we need to make sure that we have the right platform on the ground in Russia to accommodate the needs of Canadian exporters."\n\n\n<b>Are there any priority countries or priority markets in Eastern Europe?</b>\n\n"When one refers to priority or priorities, I''m also worried that people will then assume because you''re not part of the top-15, you don''t count. And when a Canadian CEO calls me about a country that may not be in the top 15 in which he is doing business and he needs help, I consider that a priority. So in my mind they''re all priorities. As soon a Canadian company needs a service from me, that''s a priority.\n\n"Now obviously when you look at our platform, you look at where our trade commissioners are, we have deployed more people in certain regions of the world than others. That''s obvious just when you look at the number of people we have in one region versus another.\n\n"But I would tell you that with respect to, for example, Eastern Europe, because you''re asking me, I''m seeing a lot more activity in many of these countries as some of these countries turn into market economies, more Canadian companies are looking at opportunities, whether it''s in mining...other types of services. In my opinion they''re all priorities."\n\n\n<b>In June, Canada signed a joint action plan with France that had three key objectives for the coming year, including more co-operation on areas like competitiveness, innovation and science and technology in a number of key areas. What kinds of resources and actions will the government be dedicating to realize this?</b>\n\n"We have been holding, as you know, these economic meetings with France for a number of years. They''re held bi-yearly. This year''s was the 15<sup>th</sup>, so it''s been going on for a number of years. \n\n"Obviously our relationship with France and the type of two-way we have between our countries and [foreign direct investment] going both ways is quite significant, and so the resources the Canadian government invests in this type of initiative is important because of the importance of the relationship. And so with the folks we already have in Paris and in Europe, and the folks we have in Ottawa supporting their efforts, we are deploying the resources that are necessary to fulfil the obligations we make under these agreements.\n\n"The reality is, when you are at the 15<sup>th</sup> of such agreements, it''s 20-30 years of history, you obviously then have a platform that allows you to implement the findings or the commitments of each and every one of these summits. So we have currently everything we require in Europe and in Canada to support this."\n\n\n<b>The plan also calls for closer economic partnership with Europe as a whole, with focus on energy, the environment and a number of other areas. How do you see energy and environmental co-operation with Europe?</b>\n\n"When you refer to the environment and energy, they really go hand-in-hand. So to me it makes a lot of sense that when one does a deal or entertains co-operation in one sector, that one also has an eye on the other. Whilst people are looking for new sources of energy, at the same time, whether in Canada or France or, actually, in most jurisdictions of the world, people are looking to promote clean and secure and affordable energy. And so that''s the focus here in Canada under our Green Plan, that''s certainly the focus in France and the EU."\n\n\n<b>The European Free Trade Association free trade agreement is currently before committee. Whether it''s going to make it before a possible election, I don''t know. But talking to the Swiss ambassador, they''ve got a number of events planned to try to promote this in Canada. Is Canada doing anything to promote it in the EFTA countries or even in Canada?</b>\n\n"We are going to get it through Parliament, and I do hope it gets done as early as possible in the fall&mdash;I won''t speculate on an election. But this is to the benefit of many Canadian companies and this not a partisan issue, it''s a bipartisan issue and I do hope that we can obtain the support of a number of the opposition parties to get this done as quickly as possible.\n\n"Once that is done, obviously we''ll do what''s necessary here in Canada and abroad to ensure we promote we promote the benefits of this agreement with Canadian companies and also non-Canadian companies who are based in those four countries, for them to look at Canada as an opportunity."\n\n\n<b>Do you get a sense that because that agreement has been signed, the European Union is more likely or there''s a more favourable attitude towards the possibility of an agreement with Canada?</b>\n\n"Whether the fact that we sign an agreement or not boosts the notoriety of fact that we''re trying to do a deal with the EU, I can''t say. All I''ll say is I found, as I said earlier, with my colleagues in Geneva, those from the EU that attended, including Peter Mandelson, there was a great desire of sitting down with Canada and entertaining a closer economic relationship.\n\n"Obviously when they look at us in terms of how our economy is structured, and the type of relationship we''ve had with several of the EU members, clearly that''s an advantage. But they also look at the type of FTA we have signed with other countries, and I''m sure that''s looked at favourably by several members of EU."\n\n\n<b>Does Canada have any plans to open more trade offices in Europe or allocate more trade commissioners as we''ve seen in Asia and Latin America?</b>\n\n"That''s a good question. As you know, we''ve made announcements with respect to Latin America and Asia. I think one needs to look at the platform on a regular basis because needs increase, needs shift. This is, to me, not something that''s cast in stone for years and decades to come.\n\n"The current platform&mdash;I''ve been on the job for two months&mdash;but the platform as I look at it right now, in terms of our footprint, is well designed to the current needs of Canadian businesses. Now, I''m not saying that won''t change, but currently I''m not dissatisfied with how we''re structured on a global basis."\n\n<i>lee@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'fortier-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(5999, '<b>Open Skies Negotiations with the EU</b>  \n', 'In 2007, after concluding negotiations with the United States, the European Commission invited Canada to negotiate a new single air transport services agreement with the EU to replace Canada''s existing agreements with 17 EU member states and presumably with the other states that have joined the EU Common Aviation Area.', 'In 2007, after concluding negotiations with the United States, the European Commission invited Canada to negotiate a new single air transport services agreement with the EU to replace Canada''s existing agreements with 17 EU member states and presumably with the other states that have joined the EU Common Aviation Area.\n\nCanada might have been better advised to negotiate with the Commission before the EU-U.S. negotiations, or to join with the United States in attempting to negotiate a North Atlantic Open Skies Agreement with the EU. However, counsels of prudence prevailed, and Canada must now work with the existing EU&ndash;U.S. model that has been established.\n\nCanada has little choice but to accede to the EU request to renegotiate the 17 existing bilateral air transport agreements. But the EU request to replace those bilaterals with a single new Canada&ndash;EU agreement will be delicate. Air transportation has always been regulated by bilateral agreements, but the transfer of authority to the European Commission to negotiate a single agreement on behalf of member states is a very new development. \n\nEU member states have been obliged by decisions of the European Court of Justice to seek adjustments to all their bilaterals in order to ensure that all EU air carriers be treated abroad on an equal basis, and that their air transport rights should no longer be linked to a single EU member. Member states are under a legal obligation to seek these changes with their partners around the world.\n\nIn principle, the Commission is seeking complete freedom for European carriers to provide air transport services in Canada, comparable to the freedom that they now enjoy throughout the EU and the European  Common Aviation Area. But in all likelihood, the Commission will have to settle for less, and accept an agreement comparable to the 2007 EU &ndash;U.S. bilateral, which has granted greater direct access to all American and European cities.\n\nIf this were to be agreed by Canada, European carriers could chose to fly directly from Europe to any Canadian city without seeking any further authorisation and Canadian carriers would have the same right to fly to Europe.\n\nGiven the absence of any appropriate agreement with the U.S. for European carriers to fly to the U.S. after landing in Canada, it seems that Canada will miss the opportunity to encourage European carriers to use major Canadian cities as transit points for European through travel to the U.S. \n\nThe hard choices for Canada involve determining how to respond to the EU request to allow freedom of transportation of EU air carriers between Canadian cities, which the EU can offer Canadian carriers in the European Common Aviation Area as all European carriers are free to offer their services throughout the Common Aviation Area regardless of nationality.\n\nEqually hard will be the response to the EU request to abandon the national ownership and control rule on a reciprocal basis. Currently, air transport rights are granted to carriers of a country, which guarantees that they are owned and controlled by its nationals. This rule has been abandoned within the EU, and in the future, EU partners will have to accept that European carriers are linked to the EU but not to any single EU member state.\n\nBoth such measures would greatly increase competition in Canada, but would open Canadian carriers to the possibility of more competition between Canadian cities and to the possibility of European takeovers. Both measures would also provide much greater freedom of choice to Canadian consumers, as they do in the EU, but almost certainly counsels of prudence in Canada will prevail, and Canada will resist the Commission''s request, as did the U.S. \n\nA further option would be to link this negotiation with EU&ndash;Canada trade negotiations. This makes eminent good sense, as air services are services like all others&mdash;as has been shown by the EU experience. Will Canadian counsels of prudence prevail here? Perhaps not.\n\n<i>Armand de Mestral is the Jean Monnet professor of law at McGill University and a researcher with the strategic knowledge cluster Canada-Europe Transatlantic Dialogue.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n', '', NULL, 25, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'mestral-8-20-2008', 1219204800, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6000, '<b> Canada ''Protesteth Too Much'' On Seals, Fish</b>  \n', 'Donald Barry says the Humane Society of the United States-led Canadian seafood boycott has had no effect on fish sales ("How to Save Canada''s Endangered Seal Hunt," Aug.', 'Donald Barry says the Humane Society of the United States-led Canadian seafood boycott has had no effect on fish sales ("How to Save Canada''s Endangered Seal Hunt," Aug. 20). He is, of course, just wrong; the boycott, by reducing demand and reducing price, has caused a huge loss to both Canadian fisherman and Atlantic Maritime communities.  Consider the facts:\n\nThe U.S. seafood boycott was launched in March 2005. The value of exports from the fishing and seafood preparation industries in Newfoundland&mdash;Canada''s main sealing province&mdash;to the U.S. dropped by 44 per cent between 2004 and 2007.  For Canada as a whole, the drop was 26 per cent.  Sales in 2008 remain well below pre-boycott levels. The value of snow crab exports, the top seafood export from Canada''s sealing provinces, is down by well over $600 million since the boycott began.\n\nSeal hunt advocates like to blame the fishing industry''s woes on exchange rates and fuel costs. Yet all exports from Canada to the U.S. face the same exchange rate and fuel issues and exports from non-seafood industries in Newfoundland are up by a wide margin.  The boycott&mdash;not the exchange rate&mdash;is specifically targeting seafood. \n\nTo date, over 600,000 individuals over 4,500 business establishments are participating in the ProtectSeals boycott. Whole Foods, Bon App&eacute;tit Management Company, Jimmy Buffett''s, Margaritaville Caf&eacute;s, Legal Seafoods and Ted''s Montana Grill (Ted Turner''s national steakhouse chain) are among the many corporate participants.  They are sending a clear message to Canada that it is time to end this cruel hunt for everyone''s sake&mdash;the fishermen, Canada''s reputation and the seals.  \n\nFinally, Mr. Barry failed to mention the considerable effort the Government of Canada is putting into fighting the boycott. If the boycott were having no impact, would the government send envoys on multiple trips to meet with U.S. companies in hopes of dissuading them from joining the boycott, have their embassy in Washington put a high-tech computer program to use in its lobby effort against the boycott or insist so fiercely that the boycott is having no effect? \n\nMethinks, Government of Canada, thou protesteth too much.  \n\n\n<b>John Grandy   </b>\n\n<b>Senior Vice-President, Wildlife and Habitat Programs</b>\n\n<b>The Humane Society of the United States</b>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 13, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'letter1-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6001, '<b>Russia Smelled NATO''s Fear and Moved In</b>  \n', 'You''re absolutely right, Mr.', 'You''re absolutely right, Mr. Temelkovski, the NATO screw-ups in Bucharest this past Spring greatly undermined NATO''s enlargement and credibility and now they''ve come back to haunt us ("Southeast Europe: What Affects One Affects All," Aug. 20). Europeans left Georgia and Ukraine in the lurch and we can see what has resulted from that. Had the French and Germans not be so lily-livered, perhaps the situation in Georgia would not exist today. Russia smelled NATO''s fear and moved in; the Europeans blinked.\n\nIn another bizarre turn of events, NATO left Macedonia out in the cold, increasing tensions in a highly volatile part of Europe. There was a consensus in support of Macedonia''s membership bid, but Greece, with the support of France, blocked it. Most observers consider that NATO was used by Greece as a tool to promote its domestic racist policies.\n\nThis kind of behaviour further undermines NATO''s reputation as an organization that promotes democratic ideals. There is definitely something very unhealthy about the way Europeans do business and it''s hurting NATO.\n\n \n<b>Dave Underwood</b>\n\n<b>Toronto, Ont.</b>\n\n\n\n\n', '', NULL, 13, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'letter2-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6002, '<b> SAT Far From a ''Dismal Failure''</b>  \n', 'Scott Taylor is a brave journalist.', 'Scott Taylor is a brave journalist.  He is one of the few who consistently travels outside the wire un-embedded and he must be respected for that.  But that respect is tarnished somewhat when he authoritatively writes about the "dismal failure" of Canada''s Strategic Advisory Team (RE: "The Demise of the Strategic Advisory Team," Aug. 20); one visit in three years is not a basis to write with any authority. Professionals check their facts. Even columnists owe their readers opinions based on the facts and, in this case, Mr. Taylor has failed.\n\nThe Strategic Advisory Team was certainly composed of military officers, but not uniquely so. From its inception it was meant to be an inter-governmental team, yet even though general Rick Hillier and Lt.-Col. Ian Hope (who had written large parts of the Afghan development plan) made the rounds in 2005 with the president of CIDA and the deputy ministers of several ministries, there was no one willing to contribute expertise to the team. CIDA offered up an employee on contract and a defence scientist from National Defence was also a member of the team.\n\nAs for the military component, post-graduate and graduate work was sought after or real-life experience that was pertinent. Thus, the military lawyer present on the team had experience in drafting and preparing legislation for parliament. And a cursory check of the individual medals would have revealed that the experience of the individual officers included Bosnia, Kosovo, Croatia, Cyprus, various countries in Africa and of Eastern.\n\nNipa Bannerjee, who from 2004 to 2006 was the head of CIDA in Afghanistan and who now teaches development at the University of Ottawa, wrote in a recent article that "Before SAT could prove if it would leave a permanent imprint on the building of sustainable capacity, its life was cut short as the Canadian government.... While there is the potential of the inclusion of a few of our CF colleagues in the new team, the strength of a well-disciplined commander-led team will be missed. The value added of a DND team lay in the deployment of disciplined teams, well-trained and supervised to deliver at the operational levels."\n\nThere is also something amiss in Mr. Taylor''s characterization of NATO''s not being able to fathom why Canada would embark on such a project.  What is amiss is that only last month, NATO sent a large reconnaissance team to the SAT to capture lessons learned in the hope of erecting a team on similar lines as Canada''s SAT. General Egon Ramm''s, NATO''s operational level commander, was effusive in his praise in a letter to the Supreme Allied Commander, and NATO''s deputy chairman of the military committee wrote about how much this team had been able to accomplish, was needed and admired, and that it was a shame that it was being disbanded.\n\nBut probably the most important word belongs to that of Afghans themselves. Time and time again, Afghan ministers have pleaded with the Canadian government to reconsider its position through the Canadian Embassy in Kabul. In a recent book on state-building, Dr. Ashraf Ghani, a former World Bank economist, a prominent Afghan reformer and the minister of finance in the first Karzai government, describes SAT-A as one of the very few effective international contributions to capacity building within the Afghan government.\n\nIt is not coincidental that these Afghan testimonials were pre-emptively cut short by those who had resisted the deployment of the SAT since its inception in the summer of 2005. What will become of their hopes that at least individual members might be loaned to the Afghan government remains to be seen. Certainly what replaces the SAT will never equal its output or its loyalty to Afghans as time and time again, we have seen how private contractors are motivated by nothing more than money and CV entries.\n\nBut intriguingly, Mr. Taylor misses all this and sloughs off any allegation of internecine conflicts between other ministries and DND without at least checking facts with any number of people, including former ambassadors, military staff, former CIDA members and former SAT team members. Instead, he dismisses these real issues by describing them as the fantasy musings of militarily co-opted journalists "barking and baying at the moon" and caricature "Colonel Blimps."\n\n\n<b>Mike Capstick, M.S.M.</b>\n\n<b>Retired Colonel</b>\n\n<b>Former Strategy Advisory Team Commander-Afghanistan, 2005-2006</b>\n\n<b>Montreal, Que.</b>\n\n\n<b>George Petrolekas, </b><b>M.S.M</b>\n\n<b>Former Canadian Liaison Officer, NATO Operation Headquarters</b>\n\n<b>Saint Andrews, N.B.</b>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 13, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'letter3-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6003, '<b> Pakistan Pulling Its Weight on Drug, Arms Smuggling</b>  \n', 'Pakistan has played a leading role in sensitizing the international community to the drug problem at the regional and international level (RE: "Navy Tries to Bolster Pakistan''s Failing War on Heroin Smugglers," Aug.', 'Pakistan has played a leading role in sensitizing the international community to the drug problem at the regional and international level (RE: "Navy Tries to Bolster Pakistan''s Failing War on Heroin Smugglers," Aug. 20). In our own country, we have succeeded in the elimination of illicit crops through a combination of law enforcement and alternate development initiatives. At the same time, we are actively engaged in international efforts to stop the outflow of narcotics from our neighbourhood and the inflow of precursor chemicals to prevent drug production.\n\nOn the illicit drugs front, the Anti-Narcotics Force in Pakistan has played a critical role not only in turning Pakistan into a poppy-free country, but also in interdicting the smuggling of drugs. There is no gainsaying the fact that co-operation with our associates has been recognized and appreciated by our international partners.\n\nWe are committed to eliminating the scourge of drug trafficking. There is an intensive mechanism established. \n\nThe strategy of the ANF is to work for the elimination of poppy cultivation, destruction of heroin laboratories and interdiction of precursor control. It is also working for demand reduction through mass awareness as well as treatment and rehabilitation programs. The ANF has strong linkages with NGOs to work together with them for implementing an aggressive strategy to counter supply as well as reduce demand.\n\nThe Frontier Corps, based in Peshawar, Northwest Frontier Province and Quetta, Baluchistan, is responsible for protecting our western borders from drug and arms smuggling. The force comprises 14 units based in the Northwest Frontier and 13 units based in Baluchistan.\n\nThe 2,500-strong Maritime Security Agency, headquartered in Karachi, is a coast guard responsible for patrolling Pakistan''s territorial waters. The MSA is equipped with a former Pakistan Navy destroyer, two coastal patrol craft and four oceanic patrol craft. They co-operate with and provide assistance to Customs, Coast Guards and other departments in checking drugs and arms smuggling.\n\nPakistan also has a Container Security Initiative, with the help of the American government, which is focused on screening and security testing all containers that are loaded and off-loaded at our ports in Karachi and Port Qasim. This is with the aim to ensure that no illegal drugs or arms enter or exit Pakistani ports. The Pakistan Customs Authority is implementing this with state-of-the-art technology. Canada is also supporting Pakistan and the recent visit of HMCS Iroquois to Pakistan was part of our joint efforts to fight this menace.\n\nWhile there are reasons to be optimistic, we have to be mindful of new patterns and trends, which necessitate timely action for the success of strategies against the global drug menace. Lenient policies towards drug abuse in certain regions need to be checked since they are hampering the demand reduction strategy.\n\nThe solution to the global drug problem and the realization of our shared objective of a drug-free world needs a sustained and prolonged strategy both at regional and international levels. It entails addressing related threats of terrorism, money-laundering, violent crimes and other problems that have a bearing in this regard. Pakistan remains committed to forging effective partnerships at the international level, to curb the threats posed by drugs, organized crime and terrorism.\n\nI would like to reiterate that Pakistan takes the issue of heroin and arms smuggling very seriously and is taking all possible measures to address them nationally, regionally and internationally. We deeply appreciate the support of the international community, but the world should also appreciate Pakistan''s efforts in this regard. It is not "Pakistan''s failing war."

Around that name has revolved a national soul-search, in which the age-old tension between the need for security and civil liberties has played out on Canadian soil.\n\nWith the release of <i>Dark Days: The Story of Four Canadians Tortured in the Name of Fighting Terror</i>, a chief flag bearer of the civil rights camp has made a valuable contribution to her cause.\n\nKerry Pither, a first-time author, has dedicated the last five and a half years of her life to assisting Canadian terror suspects in their fight for justice. \n\nEmployed by the Solidarity Network, a civil liberties NGO, Ms. Pither became involved in Mr. Arar''s case during the earliest days, when she assisted his spouse Monia Mazigh in a protracted campaign for her husband''s release from a Syrian torture centre. \n\nMs. Pither''s interest in the Arar affair soon spilled over to three other Muslim Canadian terror suspects who met a similar fate: Ahmad El Maati, Abdullah Almalki, and Muayyed Nureddin.\n\nSimilar to Mr. Arar, who wrote the forward for <i>Dark Days</i>, these men were tortured in Syria with the alleged complicity of Canadian security and diplomatic agencies. \n\nAfter scrupulous research and extended interviews with both the men themselves and some of the Canadian officials that managed their cases, what has emerged is a detailed event-by-event account of these men''s harassment, torture and release. \n\nCharming, good-humoured and engaging, Ms. Pither denies the label of a civil liberties crusader as she sips a cranberry and soda at the Chateau Laurier on Sunday afternoon. \n\nBut she sure sounds like one.\n\nShe says that more important than the guilt or innocence of individual suspects is the need to stand up for the respect of justice, due process and the rule of law here at home. \n\n"The whole reason I wrote this book is because the presumption of innocence is such an important and crucial pillar of our democracy, of what makes Canada Canada," she says. \n\n"I have complete confidence that the more Canadians know about these cases, the more Canadians will realize these weren''t just dark days for these individual men, they were dark days for everyone in this country, and for the many, many people who have struggled for many years to build here a system based on the rule of law."\n\nMs. Pither says she wrote this book to tell the stories of men who were smeared by malevolent and anonymous "senior officials" and convicted in a dehumanizing national press.\n\nHer intent, she said, was to turn the light onto the RCMP, Canadian Security Intelligence Service and Foreign Affairs officials who caused these men such problems.  \n\n"We now have ample evidence of wrongdoing on the part of these agencies when it comes to these men''s cases," she says. "So let''s turn it around. Let''s look at the agencies through the eyes of the men they targeted."\n\nMany Canadians are now aware that these men were tortured by agents of Syrian intelligence''s Palestine Branch. This book, however, gives a chilling look inside these turgid jails and into the banality of pain their wards became accustomed to.\n\n"The worst lashes with the cables are the first five or ten, then the pain gets duller," Mr. Almakli is quoted, remembering the first of many beatings aimed at the soles of his feet.\n\nMs. Pither, who spent hours upon hours with the men teasing out details of their detention, also shares the wrenching mental distress of free men becoming helpless captives.\n\n"Then it came," she writes, describing Mr. Almakli''s arrival at detainment. "A slap, hard, across the face.\n\n"Abdullah''s whole world shifted at that moment," she writes. "For the first time in his adult life, he had no control. His skills, his confidence, his upbringing couldn''t help him now. There was no negotiating with these people. This was a totally different world."\n\nFor those who have followed the cases, the cast of characters will be familiar. Among the dramatis personae are crusading spouses like Monia Mazigh, consular officials like Gar Pardy, Justice Gordon O''Connor and Liberal MP and former parliamentary secretary for Canadians abroad Dan McTeague.\n\n On Wednesday night, the champions of the civil liberties camp will come together at the National Archives to celebrate the launch of the book. \n\nThe discussion forum will bring together subject heavyweights like secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada Alex Neve, two-term chair of the Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP Shirley Heafey, and Sheema Khan, <i>Globe and Mail</i> columnist and former chair of the Canadian Council on American Islamic Relations\n\nWhile pleased with her work thus far, Ms. Pither says the battle for justice in the case of four Canadians unjustly tortured must continue.\n\nWhile two inquiries into the men''s cases have been called, Ms. Pither says those most responsible for the destruction of their lives remain masked by bureaucratic anonymity. Those bureaucrats who, on condition of anonymity, levelled the devastating accusations that turned these men into social pariahs remain unidentified and unpunished, she says.\n\n"These high-ranking senior officials," she says, "we don''t know who they are, we don''t know if they''re still in positions of power around these kinds of issues, we don''t know if they''ve been promoted...That lack of accountability is very serious.\n\n"There is still a long way to go, and I hope this book helps," she says. "I''m not sure we''re going to get all the answers we need from the [ongoing] Iaccobucci Inquiry [into the cases of Messrs. El Maati, Almalki and Nureddin] and I think we''re going to need to keep asking those questions."\n\n<i>jdavis@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n\n', '', NULL, 11, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'book_review-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6005, '<b>Ottawa Cultural Listings</b>  \n', '<i>Submit your Ottawa-based event to listings@embassymag.ca or fax to 613-232-9055 by Friday at 5p.m.</i>\n\n\n<b> WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27</b>\n\nThe Republic of <b>Moldova </b>celebrates its National Day today.', '<i>Submit your Ottawa-based event to listings@embassymag.ca or fax to 613-232-9055 by Friday at 5p.m.</i>\n\n\n<b> WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27</b>\n\nThe Republic of <b>Moldova </b>celebrates its National Day today.

This, he explained, would lead to sustainable development in the North, which has been sorely lacking.\n\nSet aside, for a moment, whether Canadian taxpayers should be footing the bill to map potential resources so companies can reap the rewards. The new funding commitment, combined with announcements made on previous trips the prime minister has taken to the region, really lays bare Mr. Harper''s vision for Canada''s Far North.\n\nEssentially, Stephen Harper''s Arctic will see mining, oil and gas operations popping up throughout the North. Sustainable development? There are some who would argue with this definition.\n\nExcept that this is really only half the vision. \n\nThe international race for control of the Arctic is well underway, and doubtless it will involve even more displays of military might, an increased number of research missions by all parties and greater social spending to shore up perceptions of sovereignty.\n\nCanada is at the forefront of this race, which is becoming increasingly tense given the huge stakes and players involved, namely a United States that has seen the issue pop up big on its radar and a newly aggressive Russia.\n\nIn a survey conducted on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade at the beginning of the year, Canadians identified asserting Canada''s Arctic sovereignty as the country''s top foreign policy priority.\n\nIt''s unclear how much of this has to do with protecting existing Canadian territory&mdash;including the Northwest Passage&mdash;and how much was about control of the Arctic seafloor and its bevy of natural resources. Not that it really matters; the two issues have become almost inextricably linked, at least in public and political opinion.\n\nIt''s against this backdrop that Mr. Harper has been trying to portray himself as strong on asserting Canadian sovereignty in the North, and is expected to use the Arctic as a major plank in his party''s platform during the coming election. \n\nSince taking power, the prime minister has promised to expand the Arctic Rangers, paved the way for the construction of new military bases in the Far North, and set aside money for a new polar-class icebreaker and armed Arctic patrol ships. Never mind that there has been little movement on any of these areas, the announcements have been made.\n\nMeanwhile, the prime minister''s visit came days after the government, led by the Canadian military, conducted its annual Nanook 2008 training exercise, and amid reports of Canadian fighter jets keeping their eyes on Russian bomber patrols.\n\nGiven all of this, the prime minister''s vision for the North becomes quite clear: mining, oil and gas operations guarded by Canadian military forces from foreign forces. A strong image of prosperity backed up with the protection of Canadian sovereignty.\n\nOf course, for this strategy to work, one would have to disregard the fact that Canada hasn''t solidified its claim to the continental shelf, that environmental concerns are going to complicate any natural resource development in the North, and that Canada is seriously outgunned by Russia and the United States, the two most likely interlopers.\n\nNot that it really matters. All the government has to do is make sure its message that it is developing the North and protecting Canadian sovereignty gets through in the next election, and then it''s free to shape reality.\n\n\n', '', NULL, 4, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'editorial-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);INSERT INTO `story` (`story_id`, `story_title`, `story_brief`, `story_content`, `story_kicker`, `story_cutline`, `story_section_id`, `story_section_heading_id`, `story_super_section_id`, `story_front_page`, `story_order`, `story_url_id`, `story_issue_date`, `story_status`, `story_updated`, `story_lock_current_issue`, `story_lock_archives`, `story_hit_view`, `story_hit_email`, `story_hit_blog`) VALUES (6007, '<b> The Great Missile Defence Scam</b>  \n', 'Cynicism and hypocrisy are always part of international politics, but in the case of Poland and the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) missiles, everybody is over-fulfilling their norm.', 'Cynicism and hypocrisy are always part of international politics, but in the case of Poland and the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) missiles, everybody is over-fulfilling their norm.\n\nNobody involved in the controversy, Polish, Russian or American, believes a single word they are saying about this misbegotten missile defence system, whose principal characteristic is that it doesn''t work&mdash;never has, and probably never will. And yet we''re all expected to report what they say as if it mattered.\n\nWashington insists that the ABM missiles are being put into Poland to protect the United States and its allies from Iran''s long-range ballistic missiles (which do not exist) tipped with nuclear warheads (which Iran doesn''t have either). Yet after months when U.S.-Polish talks on the subject were stalled, suddenly last Wednesday, Warsaw agreed to provide a base for the "missile defence system"&mdash;because it would infuriate the Russians.\n\nThe Poles, who are anxious about Russia''s intentions in light of recent events in Georgia, want to send a signal of defiance to Moscow and get a permanent American military base of some kind on their soil. They''re not worried about non-existent Iranian missiles&mdash;and if they do occasionally worry about very real Russian missiles, they are not so foolish as to believe that this American missile defence system would actually protect them. It doesn''t work.\n\nSo why are the Russians so upset about all this?  Why did General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, publicly warn Poland last week that hosting the American interceptors could make it the target for a nuclear strike? Don''t the Russians know they don''t work?\n\nOf course they do, but the Russian military, like any professional military force, needs a dramatic foreign threat to justify its demands on Russia''s resources, and for that purely political purpose the American missiles work fine. Russian strategists claim that this system is actually intended to shoot down Russian ballistic missiles, and so undermine Russia''s ability to deter an American attack by destroying its ability to strike back.\n\nIt''s nonsense, of course. Even if the American ABM missiles did work as advertised, 10 launchers on Poland''s Baltic coast are not going to make much difference given Russia''s 848 long-range ballistic missiles, including hundreds that can be launched from submarines that are much closer to the U.S. than the interceptors in Poland. The Russians are only pretending to be worried about the ABM missiles in Poland, although they are seriously annoyed by U.S. military bases there.\n\nThe symbolic importance of the U.S. opening a new military base so close to Russia in the midst of the diplomatic confrontation over Georgia is clear to everybody, and Moscow is reacting to that. Even so, to threaten a nuclear strike against Poland sounds a bit extreme&mdash;except that in reality it doesn''t mean a thing, and everybody knows that, too.\n\nPoland is already a target for nuclear strikes in the most improbable event of a Russian-American nuclear war. Everybody in the American-led NATO alliance is. Yet they don''t lose much sleep over it, because such a war is so very unlikely. General Nogovitsyn didn''t announce a new policy; he just spoke more frankly than usual about a permanent reality, in the hope of intimidating the more naive sections of the Polish population.\n\nIt would make about as much sense militarily if this mini-crisis were about the basing of a crack American team of kung fu dancers in Poland. The new American missile defence base in Poland gives all the interested parties a way to make their political points, while having no serious strategic importance whatsoever. But why has the United States spent between $120 billion and $150 billion on this ludicrous white elephant of a system since President Ronald Reagan first launched the "Star Wars" project in 1983?\n\nPrecisely because ever since 1983, the missile defence project has provided American senators, congressmen and presidents with the opportunity to pour enormous amounts of money into the pockets of defence industry, in return for much smaller but politically vital campaign contributions by those same companies. The technology can never be made cost-effective, but the project is impossible to kill because so many politicians benefit from it.\n\nHow can we know that the technology will never be cost-effective? Because even if the technology could finally be made to work to specifications, the whole notion of ballistic missile defence is ridiculous. It will always be 10 to 100 times cheaper to evade the ABM defences by adding decoys and other "penetration aids" to the incoming warheads, making them manoeuvrable, etc. than it is to upgrade the performance of the interceptors.\n\nThat performance, after a quarter-century''s work, is so poor that only two out of the last five tests worked. And those tests are rigged in the ABM system''s favour, with the defenders knowing the incoming missile''s type, trajectory and destination. In more recent tests, they have used no decoys at all in an attempt to get the hit rate up. And yet they have deployed the system anyway, first in Alaska and now in Poland.\n\nThis is fantasy strategy in the service of the military-industrial complex, and no strategist in the know takes it seriously. But it does allow the owner to make quite impressive symbolic gestures, albeit rather expensive ones.\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 3, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'dyer-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6008, '<b>Ultimate Motivation to Properly Equip His Soldiers</b>  \n', 'On Wednesday, Aug.', 'On Wednesday, Aug. 13, I sat down for a brief chat with Lt.-Gen. Andrew Leslie. Since 2006, he has held the post of chief of land staff&mdash;army commander in layman''s terms, but he has also been twice pipped at the post to win in the race for the top job.\n\nIn 2005, Leslie was then-defence minister Bill Graham''s choice for chief of defence staff, but Paul Martin overruled that recommendation and promoted Rick Hillier instead.\n\nWhen Hillier announced his retirement this past April, Leslie was once again a frontrunner in the CDS sweepstakes. Of course this time it was Gen. Walter Natynczyk who received the blessing of Prime Minister Stephen Harper to become Canada''s top soldier.\n\nEarlier in his career, Leslie frequently made public comment that he aspired to one day be the chief of defence staff and he felt he had the family pedigree to make such an appointment almost inevitable. The Leslie lineage includes the famous Second World War Lt.-Gen. Andrew McNaughton and defence minister Brooke Claxton as grandfathers.\n\nHowever, if he was disappointed for being passed over for promotion, he hid it well.\n\n"What, was I even in the running for that?" he deadpanned. "I have no plans to go anywhere, I have a great job. I''m responsible for running an army whose soldiers are fighting a war."\n\nThe magnitude of that responsibility is driven home by the fact that my interview was rescheduled and time condensed at the last minute. He was leaving his office immediately after our chat to attend the repatriation ceremony in Trenton for the bodies of Master-Corporals Joshua Roberts and Erin Doyle.\n\nPrior to assuming command in 2004, Leslie was in charge of the Canadian contingent in Kabul, where he had the sad task of conducting some of the first funeral services for fatalities suffered in Afghanistan.\n\n"I don''t have to tell you the depth of pain [each soldier killed] brings to that section, platoon, company mates and their families," he said. "The army is a family."\n\nWith 93 soldiers killed and nearly 700 wounded or injured on operations in Afghanistan to date, that attrition on an army of 35,000 regular and reserve personnel presents not only an emotional strain, but also a practical challenge in keeping a 2,500-strong battle group deployed to Kandahar through 2011.\n\nOne of the suggestions put forward to alleviate the manpower shortage was to extend the current length of the soldiers'' tour of duty. However, during his recent visit to Kandahar, Gen. Natynczyk assured the troops that the Canadian army would not go that particular route, and six-month tours would remain the norm.\n\nLeslie admitted that the elimination of this solution would increase his own challenge&mdash;not unlike juggling yet another chainsaw.\n\n"That''s a self-inflicted chainsaw. The chief [of defence staff] made the final call, but my recommendation to him was to keep the six-month limit," he said. "From a purely, coldly logical point of view, if emotions and operational temp and impact on families weren''t factored in...why not send soldiers overseas for three to four years?"\n\nInstead, Leslie took the question to his senior leaders, sergeant majors, family resource centres and, most importantly, the spouses. The overwhelming consensus was not to extend the tours.\n\n"So the battle group tours remain six months, and we can sustain it," he says. "Is it getting tougher? Yep, but we can do it."\n\nThe equipment items that topped the general''s wishlist&mdash;heavy-lift helicopters and improved unmanned aerial vehicles&mdash;have already been addressed, but there are still many other pieces of kit the army commander would like to see fielded as soon as possible. \n\n"I need a heavy infantry assault vehicle, not in large numbers, in limited numbers with a better ability to protect the young folk when they''re rumbling around in a scenario where there are all sorts of IEDS, mines and other unpleasantries," said Leslie. "After that, we need an armoured patrol vehicle which is more heavily protected then the G-Wagon, but is not as large as the Coyote."\n\nGiven the operational impetus of putting new material in the hands of the soldiers as quickly as possible, the normally sluggish and ponderous procurement system has at times been ramped up to ramming speed. Quite often the speed of the acquisition&mdash;from factory to front line&mdash;brings about its own set of difficulties for operators and technicians.\n\n"Every month there''s a new big box that arrives in Afghanistan, which soldiers get to unwrap," he said. "Of course, we''re putting just about everything we have out forward to the deployed troops, which means we don''t have the training stocks, we don''t have the instructional procedures, we don''t have the mechanized skills."\n\nWhile Leslie went on to praise the troops for their ability to overcome these shortfalls, he also noted that this same successful innovation by soldiers in the field diminishes the political "energy and enthusiasm" to procure the necessary training stocks.\n\nSadly, nothing proves more motivating than the task that still awaited the army commander at the conclusion of our interview&mdash;the daunting reality of comforting loved ones who have last lost a family member in the service of Canada.\n\n<i>Scott Taylor is publisher and editor of </i>Esprit de Corps <i>magazine.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 32, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'inside_defence-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6009, '<b> Trade Agreements As a Tool to Further Human Rights</b>  \n', 'As the curtain fell on the Beijing Olympic Games, a U.S.-based coalition is striving to keep the spotlight squarely focused on China.', 'As the curtain fell on the Beijing Olympic Games, a U.S.-based coalition is striving to keep the spotlight squarely focused on China.\n\nThe California First Amendment Coalition (CFAC) is urging the U.S. government to launch a formal complaint against China at the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, alleging that the country''s heavy-handed Internet censorship violates world trading rules.\n\nThe CFAC points to blocks placed on popular foreign websites&mdash;including Youtube and BBC news&mdash;that "are either deemed offensive by Chinese government censors, or are feared by the government as potential platforms for self-expression by Chinese citizens."\n\nThe group adds that screening by Chinese authorities means that the performance of foreign websites is degraded relative to Chinese websites&mdash;meaning that foreigners are effectively subjected to discrimination, contrary to world trade laws.\n\nThe <i>Financial Times</i> reports that major Internet players like Yahoo and Google are somewhat ambivalent about a full-frontal legal assault on China. To be sure, Google has pushed for the United States to put the topic of Internet censorship on the agenda of future trade negotiations, in an effort to coax the Chinese government into more liberal treatment of news and Internet organizations. But the <i>Financial Times</i> reports that Google and Yahoo are a bit more guarded when it comes to the CFAC''s desire to drag China before a panel of trade arbitrators. \n\nHowever, the CFAC insists that China''s existing obligations as a WTO member-state provide sufficient legal foothold for the U.S. to mount a challenge to current Chinese practices.\n\nThere is a definite novelty to the use of trade and economic agreements to further human rights objectives, such as freedom of expression. When you live in a global village where most of the binding and enforceable international rules are economic ones, it can be tempting for human rights advocates to pick up such tools and see if they can be appropriated for a different purpose. \n\nOn rare occasions, they can.\n\nFor example, there are scant international protections afforded to charities or development agencies operating in overseas territories. For the most part, such groups find themselves at the mercies of authoritarian governments, or warring factions, with little except moral suasion and the diplomatic support of home-governments to guarantee the safe passage of staff members and the unimpeded operation of relief, development or other charitable activities.\n\nDuring Zimbabwe''s recent contested election process, all private voluntary organizations and non-governmental organizations were ordered to suspend their field operations after the ruling Zanu-PF party accused them of political meddling. Groups like Oxfam and Care International were forced to idle their relief activities, thus exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in that country.\n\nIn countless other contexts, repressive governments have cracked down on foreign NGOs, withdrawing their work authorizations, seizing their offices and equipment, and even terminating the legal status of organizations. \n\nMany governments, particularly in the former Soviet Union, have grown especially suspicious of foreign funding of not-for-profit organizations, fearing that Western governments may be funneling funds through NGOs in order to support political or human rights reforms. \n\nPerhaps most notoriously, the Open Society Institute, a major donor organization created by the financier George Soros, saw its operations in Uzbekistan shut down in 2004. Before its summary exit, the organization had complained that government officials were taking a fine-tooth comb to its operations, thus grinding to a halt many of the institute''s health, education, and legal reform projects.\n\nThe recipients of such unwelcome advances can appeal to the local courts, but this can be a perilous exercise, particularly in countries where the judiciary owe their appointments and livelihoods to political masters. Another less-discussed alternative is for victims to turn to international trade and economic agreements&mdash;in much the same fashion as the U.S.-based CFAC is seeking to use global trade rules to target Internet censorship.\n\nAt least some international treaties that protect trade and economic activities on the global stage may be malleable enough that they protect certain <i>not-for-profit</i> activities as well. \n\nIn a research paper prepared with a colleague for the Washington-based International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL), we found that groups like Oxfam, Care International and the Open Society Institute may be able to challenge at least some forms of repressive treatment by invoking the terms of <i>economic</i> treaties concluded by their host-countries. Many of these treaties are couched in broad terms and may protect certain economic-development activities undertaken by <i>not-for-profit</i> organizations.\n\nOf course, it would be ironic if trade and economic treaties&mdash;which come in for routine (and sometimes justified) criticism from many non-governmental organizations&mdash;harboured some benefits for those same NGOs.\n\nWithout wishing to overstate such benefits, at least some NGOs committed to the cause of freedom of expression or to ministering to the basic needs of others could be pleasantly surprised to discover that the legal ground-rules of economic globalization are not as one-dimensional as sometimes thought.\n\n<i>Luke Eric Peterson is an </i>Embassy<i> columnist and the editor of </i>Investment Arbitration Reporter <i>(www.iareporter.com) an electronic news service tracking international lawsuits between multinationals and sovereign governments.</i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 3, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'peterson-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6010, '<b> A Long, Eventful Road from Barbados to Canada</b>  \n', 'With high-level political experience in trade, international tourism and labour, Barbados''s new high commissioner, <b>Edward Evelyn Greaves</b>, seems as well prepared as any diplomat could be for his first-ever foreign posting.', 'With high-level political experience in trade, international tourism and labour, Barbados''s new high commissioner, <b>Edward Evelyn Greaves</b>, seems as well prepared as any diplomat could be for his first-ever foreign posting.\n\nAlthough he has had a successful and active political career, having most recently returned to the political arena to manage a candidate''s campaign in the Caribbean country''s January elections, Mr. Greaves insists that he is first and foremost a trade unionist.\n\nBefore coming to Ottawa, Mr. Greaves worked as an industrial consultant and, from 1996 until 2002, was based in Trinidad and Tobago as the senior specialist for workers'' activities at the International Labour Organization''s Caribbean Office. \n\nMr. Greaves was first recruited to work in Barbados''s union movement in 1968 when he was a 27 year-old teacher, just fresh out school himself. He embraced the work, running education programs for the Barbados Workers'' Union and rising through the ranks to become deputy general secretary of the union.\n\n"The trade union environment has always been very strong, a force to be reckoned with," Mr. Greaves says. "Some aspects were taken from the government of Ontario, the trade union was in touch with Ontario''s."\n\nThen, in 1971, when Mr. Greaves was 31 years old, the country''s prime minister recruited him to run for Parliament. He did, and he won.\n\n"That first election campaign, we had fun," he says. \n\nMr. Greaves has also served in the Senate and as a member of Cabinet, as minister of trade, commerce and industry and as minister of international tourism. In 1991, he was decorated with the Barbados Gold Crown of Merit in honour of his service.\n\nAs minister of trade, industry and commerce, Mr. Greaves participated in the first Uruguay round, which eventually led to the creation of the World Trade Organization. He was also involved in trade negotiations with Europe, which eventually led to the Caribbean-EU economic partnership. In 1988, Mr. Greaves led an investment promotion team to Canada, which has now become one of Barbados''s top investors.\n\nNow, as high commissioner, Mr. Greaves hopes to attract Canadian investors to the country''s growing arts and cultural sector. Earlier this month, Mr. Greaves travelled to the popular theatre town of Stratford, Ont., in hopes of building partnerships and luring artists to train and perform in Barbados during Canada''s winter months.\n\nOnce a top tourist destination for Canadians, particularly in the 1960s and ''70s, and now evolving into a more upscale market, Mr. Greaves said he will be focusing efforts on promoting all that Barbados has to offer vacationers.\n\nMr. Greaves said he is very pleased that the Canadian airline WestJet will offer direct flights to Barbados during the winter season, in addition to Air Canada and charter flight service. \n\nWorld-renowned for its horse racing and successful jockeys, Barbados has already attracted well-off investors such as <b>Eugene Melnyk</b>, owner of the Ottawa Senators NHL team, and sends its best jockeys to race at the Woodbine, a Toronto-area track.\n\n"We are making an impact in that area too, we have pretty skilled jockeys," Mr. Greaves said, proudly adding that Barbados is a sport nation.\n\nMr. Greaves estimates there are more than 4,000 Canadians living in Barbados, and notes there is a sizeable number of Barbadians also living in Canada.\n\n"Part of my mission is to really try to build matured relations, encourage them to keep their link to Barbados and to be interested in giving back and contributing to development of Barbados," he said.\n\nMr. Greaves comes north with several Canadian connections to boot.

That is something NATO has to address because NATO''s credibility as an alliance is extremely important."\n\nA report released this past Monday by the International Crisis Group entitled "Russia vs. Georgia: The Fallout" explores the implications of the conflict for NATO and declares that reaction to the recent fighting "has shown the paucity of EU and U.S. leverage over Russia."\n\nObservers are quick to point to this and other examples to advocate for a much-needed re-evaluation of NATO, its internal relations and just what its role in conflicts such as Afghanistan and Georgia should be.\n\nSpeaking from his office in Tbilisi, Lawrence Sheets, Caucasus project director with the International Crisis Group, said the current crisis will likely have one of two outcomes; it will exacerbate rifts within NATO, or force larger countries to step up their participation.\n\n"It''s going to be more difficult for some of those members, which were recalcitrant to publicly state their positions; countries like France and Germany were very public about their opposition to NATO membership for Georgia because they didn''t want to be seen as acquiescing to the Russians, or looking like they were only concerned about energy imports from Russia," Mr. Sheets said.\n\nHe added that one of the biggest challenges for NATO has been finding one voice for the organization because every member state has different stakes. \n\nWith its lacklustre response to NATO''s demands over Georgia, Russia''s tactics are stoking these divides, said Julie Lindhout, president of the Atlantic Council of Canada, an organization that works on issues related to NATO.\n\n"At the moment I think it''s Russia taking advantage of the divisions and this is definitely something that NATO members have to work on," Ms. Lindhout said.\n\nIf these divisions persist, it may indicate that NATO members are just not willing to respond to Russia''s aggression, Ms. Lindhout said, while others point out that in Afghanistan, such deep divisions in the alliance are already presenting challenges. \n\nAn official with Canadian Department of National Defence said that although in both cases these political divisions "are trying to be papered over," NATO''s vulnerability is being targeted.\n\n"The other side in both of these crises, in one case Russia, in the other case the Taliban, is they can play to those divisions to their advantage, and they will," the official said. "There are differences among the allies as to how deeply they want to wade into the conflict."\n\nIndeed, with a decidedly dismal deployment of troops in Afghanistan from some European NATO countries, Queen''s University professor and chair of the Defence Management Studies program Douglas Bland said it''s unlikely that any member countries, aside from maybe the Americans, are interested in engaging their vital national interests in debate with Russia over Georgia. \n\n"NATO is not stretched by any capability, it''s just stretched by the political will that military leaders might think important, but politicians don''t see," Mr. Bland said. \n\nAs Russia flexes its muscle against NATO, believed by some to be its response to the deep humiliation it still harbours over the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, NATO member countries now find themselves forced to muster up a consensus on how best to function as a unit, and now also how to re-shape its approach toward Russia.\n\nObservers say NATO''s growth in recent years to include 26 countries and opening Membership Action Plans recently to Georgia and Ukraine has brought about a situation in which newer members are bringing a fundamentally different view to the table&mdash;just one, it would seem, of the alliance''s newest challenges.\n\nNATO foreign ministers are expected to decide on MAPs for Georgia and Ukraine at a meeting in December, and there are rumors another emergency meeting may be called in September.\n\n<i>mcollins@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'nato_divides-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6013, '<b> Russian Envoy Invokes Responsibility to Protect Over Georgia</b>  \n', '', 'Russian Ambassador Georgiy Mamedov is trying to shield Russia-Canada relations from turbulence caused by his country''s involvement in Georgia, but top Canadian officials continue to indicate displeasure with Russian actions in the Caucuses and in the Arctic.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 19, a specially-convened meeting of NATO foreign ministers was held in Brussels to discuss the ongoing conflict in Georgia. Among those in attendance was Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister David Emerson.\r\n\r\nIn a joint statement, the foreign ministers expressed "grave concern" over the situation and "its wider implications for Euro-Atlantic stability and security."\r\n\r\nFollowing the foreign ministers meeting, Canadian Ambassador to NATO Robert McRae held a teleconference giving further details on Canada''s position vis-&agrave;-vis the Georgia conflict.\r\n\r\nMr. McCrae, who attended the foreign ministers'' meeting, said the joint statement touched all the points that were Canadian priorities. He said there was a "very strong consensus" among NATO allies, including Canada, of the importance that Russia respect Georgian sovereignty, territorial integrity and democracy.\r\n\r\n"Canada felt very strongly that it was not business as usual with Russia, and that the ball is in Russia''s court to implement what it has committed itself to implement and to take those steps that we''ve all been expecting Russia to take," he said.\r\n\r\n<div id="sidebar" style="width: 180px;"> Denver: Lessons in Fundraising, Word on NAFTA''s Future\r\n\r\n\r\n At a press conference on Parliament Hill last week, a group of Georgian-Canadians appealed for increased Canadian support for the people of Georgia.\r\n\r\nAfter telling stories of their suffering families, and the use of cluster bombs against civilian residences by the Russian army, the group made an appeal to Canada.\r\n\r\nTheir requests were for humanitarian aid, help in family reunification, Canadian observers for the conflict, and a Canadian embassy in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Canada does not have representation in any of the Caucasian states. The mission responsible for these countries is Canada''s embassy in Ankara, Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that an embassy be opened in Georgia, a country of 4.6 million, has gained the support of opposition parties.\r\n\r\nThe Georgian activists, led by George Nikoladze (below), were supported in their calls for action by their member of Parliament, Toronto-area Liberal Mario Silva. Mr. Silva said he supported the opening of an embassy, and so did Liberal Foreign Affairs critic Bob Rae, who met with the Georgian-Canadians during their visit to Ottawa.\r\n\r\nNDP Foreign Affairs critic Paul Dewar also endorsed the idea of an embassy in Tbilisi.\r\n\r\n"Of course there should be a Canadian presence in the Caucuses," Mr. Dewar said.\r\n\r\n<i>Embassy</i> asked officials from DFAIT, the Prime Minister''s Office and Foreign Minister David Emerson''s office if the idea was being considered. The question was submitted last week, but no response was given by press time.\r\n\r\n<i>&mdash;Jeff Davis </i></div>He added that the Canadian view was the Russians exercised a "disproportionate use of force totally inconsistent with their peacekeeping role."\r\n\r\nIn terms of NATO accession for Georgia, Mr. McCrae said Canada pushed during the meeting for continued support for the tiny country''s membership ambitions.\r\n\r\n"Coming out of today''s meeting, one of the priorities for us was a strong reaffirmation that both Georgia and Ukraine remain very much on track [for NATO membership]," he said. "In other words, that timing and that agenda are unaffected by the events of the last couple weeks."\r\n\r\nMr. McCrae said the next steps in the process of making Georgia an alliance member would occur during the next NATO foreign ministers'' meeting in December. \r\n\r\nJust days before the special meeting, Defence Minister Peter MacKay announced a planned joint military exercise between Russia, the United States and Canada had been put on ice in response to Russian action in Georgia.\r\n\r\n"In light of the current situation in Georgia, and after consultation with our American allies, we agreed that it would be inappropriate to go ahead with Exercise Vigilant Eagle, a planned combined NORAD-Russia military exercise that was scheduled to begin August 20, 2008," Mr. MacKay said in a statement.\r\n\r\nAnother chilly message was issued Sunday by Foreign Affairs Minister David Emerson who, speaking on CTV <i>Question Period</i>, expressed his "serious concern" over recent Russian actions in the Arctic and Georgia.\r\n\r\nReferencing Russia''s decision to plant a flag on the floor of the Arctic Ocean last summer, Mr. Emerson said "many thought [it] was a somewhat silly flag-planting incident in Canada''s Arctic."\r\n\r\nHowever, he added that recent activities like its actions in Georgia and the cutting off of energy supplies to Ukraine two years ago are making Canada and its allies apprehensive.\r\n\r\nMr. Emerson pointed out that Russian Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bombers have resumed flights near North American airspace in recent months. \r\n\r\n"We''ve seen much increased activity in terms of Russian overflights of Canadian airspace. The Americans are seeing the same thing around Alaska," he said.\r\n\r\n"So that''s one element, but it''s not the only element. It''s something that is now starting to give us some cause for serious concern."\r\n\r\nLast week, <i>Embassy</i> spoke by phone with Malkhaz Mikeladze, deputy chief of mission at the Georgian Embassy in Washington, D.C. He said relations between Georgia and NATO are warming.\r\n\r\n"I can tell you that NATO support has increased regarding assistance since these tragic events took place," he said.\r\n\r\nHe added that Georgian officials are in "permanent contact" with their Canadian counterparts in Brussels and Vienna, and that Canadian officials are being provided updates as events unfold. \r\n\r\nMr. Mikeladze thanked Canada for its firm support of his country.\r\n\r\n"We appreciate very much the support of Canada, and we support the readiness of the Canadian side on economical and humanitarian assistance," he said. "I think the relations are very good at this time and we will continue this level of co-operation."\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>The Russian Perspective</b>\r\n\r\nIn separate interviews Monday and Tuesday, Ambassador Mamedov made no apologies for the actions of his country in Georgia, saying that they were pushed into conflict by a "fiendish" and unprovoked Georgian attack.\r\n\r\n"On the 8<sup>th</sup> of August, the Georgian army violated international agreements signed by the Georgian government and blessed by the United Nations," he said. "For 24 hours they pounded defenseless Ossetians, killing 1,500 people, and murdering in cold blood 15 Russian peacekeepers who were there according to international agreements and at the invitation of the Georgian government."\r\n\r\nHe said he made this position clear to the Canadian government through meetings with officials at the Prime Minister''s Office. \r\n\r\nMr. Mamedov said Russian troops moved into Georgia to protect the lives of innocents. He said Russia was entitled to do so according to the terms of a Canadian innovation in international peace promotion: the Responsibility to Protect, in this case the South Ossetians.\r\n\r\n"Our tanks came to protect the lives of Ossetians and our citizens," he said. "It is a Canadian suggestion that every United Nations country has a responsibility to protect, and in this case its so clear cut I don''t know how it can be distorted."\r\n\r\nMr. Mamedov said he thought Canadian officials were choosing to ignore the facts about how the conflict started, and instead have fallen into step behind the United States.\r\n\r\n"I''m not sure Canadian authorities are as well versed in the real facts about the start of the conflicts as they should be," he said. "From their immediate public reaction, I saw they bought the American scenario."\r\n\r\nMr. Mamedov downplayed the seriousness of Mr. Emerson''s comments and the cancellation of the joint military exercise.\r\n\r\nInstead, he expressed confidence that these tensions would blow over.\r\n\r\n"My concern is that we don''t destroy the positive baggage that was accumulated in our relations with our partners over the last years," he said. "This is what I''m discussing with your government, your business community, with your political establishment.\r\n\r\n"I believe what we achieved in the military, economic and political fields, including with the Harper government over the past two years, is very solid and based both on Russian and Canadian national interests," he added. "I don''t believe there is any rationale to review [relations] in a negative way."\r\n\r\nWhile remaining optimistic Canada-Russia relations are stable enough to withstand current tensions, it appears more troubles are on the way.\r\n\r\nTensions yesterday were further strained as Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced that, as his parliament had requested, he had recognized the independence of the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia\r\n\r\n"I signed Decrees on the recognition by the Russian Federation of South Ossetia''s and Abkhazia''s independence," Mr. Medvedev said in a speech. "Russia calls on other states to follow its example. This is not an easy choice to make, but it represents the only possibility to save human lives."\r\n\r\nThis statement drew fresh criticism from Mr. Emerson late Tuesday, who condemned the move in a written statement.\r\n\r\n"Canada is gravely concerned about Russia''s recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. This recognition violates Georgia''s territorial integrity and sovereignty and is contrary to UN Security Council resolutions supported by Russia, as well as to the six-point peace plan brokered by President Nicolas Sarkozy on behalf of the EU," Mr. Emerson said.\r\n\r\nAmbassador Mamedov explained the move was taken in the face of American efforts to rearm the Georgians, and Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili''s public statements that his country would try to seize the two regions again in the future.\r\n\r\n"Since Sakashvili is still intent on new attacks against Ossetians and Abkhazians, and our American friends are speedily rearming him, the only option for us is of course to recognize their independence and have security arrangements to protect both them and our peacekeepers there," he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Mamedov vehemently denied that Russia has any intention to absorb these former Soviet territories. \r\n\r\n"[This] doesn''t mean we want to annex the country," he said. "We recognize their independence...we''re not for a land grab."\r\n\r\n<i>jdavis@embassymag.ca</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'At the same time, Ambassador Georgiy Mamedov downplays apparent upheavals in his country''s relationship with Canada.\n', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'russia-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0);INSERT INTO `story` (`story_id`, `story_title`, `story_brief`, `story_content`, `story_kicker`, `story_cutline`, `story_section_id`, `story_section_heading_id`, `story_super_section_id`, `story_front_page`, `story_order`, `story_url_id`, `story_issue_date`, `story_status`, `story_updated`, `story_lock_current_issue`, `story_lock_archives`, `story_hit_view`, `story_hit_email`, `story_hit_blog`) VALUES (6014, '<b> Emerson, PMO Met Nuclear Reps Before India Vote: Database</b>  \n', 'A week before Canada supported an International Atomic Energy Association deal required for a controversial U.S.-India nuclear co-operation agreement to proceed, representatives from Canada''s nuclear industry met with Foreign Affairs Minister David Emerson and a policy advisor from the Prime Minister''s Office, according to a new lobbying database.', 'A week before Canada supported an International Atomic Energy Association deal required for a controversial U.S.-India nuclear co-operation agreement to proceed, representatives from Canada''s nuclear industry met with Foreign Affairs Minister David Emerson and a policy advisor from the Prime Minister''s Office, according to a new lobbying database.\n\nBoth sides deny the meetings took place, but their presence on the database has raised red flags over the weight economic considerations received in deciding whether Canada would support not only the IAEA deal, but also the lifting of nuclear trade restrictions against India that have been in place since the 1970s.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, have questioned why Canada''s ambassador on non-proliferation did not represent Canadian interests at a major meeting last week to decide whether India should, for all intents and purposes, be recognized as a legitimate nuclear power.\n\nOn July 2, the government activated a new online database that requires, by way of lobbying regulations, that all lobbyists disclose meetings with politicians and senior government officials.\n\nA search of David Emerson''s name turns up two results. The first was a meeting on July 28 between what appears to be the majority of Cabinet and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.\n\nThe second was a meeting on July 25 between Mr. Emerson and the Canadian Nuclear Association, with CNA president Murray Elston named as the registering party. According to the record, the subject discussed was "International Relations."\n\nA subsequent search for Mr. Elston''s name turned up two meetings held on the previous day, July 24, with Jasmine Ignieski, a policy advisor with the Prime Minister''s Office, and Priya Joshi, senior policy advisor in Mr. Emerson''s office. The subject discussed in those meetings was "IAEA Safeguards."\n\nNo other details are offered. However, on Aug. 1, Canada was one of 35 countries to offer its unanimous support for an agreement that will see 14 of India''s 22 nuclear reactors fall under the agency''s inspection mandate, and which paved the way for the possible lifting of nuclear trade restrictions against the country.\n\nMr. Emerson''s director of communications, Anne Howland, denied yesterday either Mr. Emerson or his advisor, Ms. Joshi, had ever met with members of the CNA. She could not explain how their names appeared on the database. \n\nIn an interview with <i>Embassy</i> last week, Mr. Elston denied having personally met with Mr. Emerson or the advisors on those dates, though he did not deny officials from his association attended the meetings, and acknowledged his organization has for years "had an interest in moving this file along."\n\n\n<b>Canadian Benefits Unclear</b>\n\nMr. Elston could not quantify exactly how much Canadian industry could benefit from nuclear trade with India, saying the industry is extremely busy with domestic projects.\n\n"I would have said in the ''90s and the early 2000s, when things were not moving very quickly in the Canadian economy for nuclear, that it would have been a much more important place for us," he said. "But, of course, right now we are at a high level of activity when you consider all of the activities that are out there going on."\n\nMr. Elston also couldn''t say whether specific segments of the industry are actively looking at India right now, though he acknowledged it is unlikely Canadian companies will be reaping windfalls the moment a deal is signed.\n\n"I think thinking we''re going to be there at the very beginning is kind of lost now," he said. "Just thinking about all of the players that are already active there."\n\nStill, he said any opening up of market access was important.\n\n"For us, the opportunity for making sales in what is the world''s second-most-populous country is an extremely important thing for us," he said. "Just the sheer magnitude of work that could be available to our companies is very big. And I think from that stage on we end up having the prospect of increasing export output."\n\nWhen asked whether the CNA''s lobby efforts have had any effect over the years, Mr. Elston said: "Early on, I think it''s fair to say, the response was received, or at least our pitch was received, and as soon as the U.S.-India discussions became very intense, we likewise were interested in seeing a response. But we had very little in the way of sensing that the government would move very fast on it until just very recently indeed."\n\nThat fast movement has been characterized by surprisingly strong Canadian support at the IAEA meeting, as well as apparent Canadian support at last week''s Nuclear Suppliers Group meeting in Vienna, where the lifting of Indian nuclear trade restrictions was being debated.\n\nThe government has remained mostly coy in its stance on the issue of nuclear trade with India, but Mr. Emerson wrote a letter to the<i> Toronto Star </i>earlier this month that said: "It is truly a shame that Canada''s relations with a like-minded country have been frozen for decades. While the rest of Canada''s allies began to re-engage India in 2000, we have lagged behind."\n\nMr. Elston said the government has been receptive to "outreach opportunities" and he believed it "helps to know that there is an industry that is interested in pursuing opportunities externally." However, he said the government was moving towards supporting India anyway, and he doesn''t think the CNA was instrumental in moving Canada''s position.\n\nWhile they weren''t surprised, the fact Mr. Emerson and his senior advisors and PMO staff met with nuclear industry officials has raised concerns among those who have been lobbying hard to convince the government not to support the lifting of Indian nuclear trade restrictions.\n\n"This would be deeply worrisome if Canada''s non-proliferation policies are being driven by the trade interests of just one sector, as opposed to our international obligations and our commitment to nuclear non-proliferation treaty," said Anthony Salloum, program director at the Rideau Institute, which is serving as secretariat of the international network of anti-nuclear groups Abolition 2000.\n\n"I would also remind Minister Emerson that he is no longer the minister of trade. He is now the minister of foreign affairs. So as much as he loves trade, he needs to shift his focus a bit to the broader vision of where Canada wants to be in the world."\n\n\n<b>Canada Quiet in Vienna</b>\n\nOn Aug. 20-21, the 45 members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group met in Vienna, Austria, to discuss whether to lift nuclear trade exemptions from India, thereby eliminating the last hurdle to the U.S.-India civilian nuclear co-operation deal and opening the Asian country up to other nuclear exporters.\n\nAccording to a spokesman at the Depart-ment of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Canada was represented at the meeting by Marie Gervais-Vidricaire, the country''s ambassador to Austria and permanent representative to the international organizations in Vienna.\n\nThe meeting ended without a definitive answer after a number of countries&mdash;including Austria, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland&mdash;reportedly raised serious concerns over the U.S.-India deal and proposed several amendments.\n\nBecause the meetings were held behind closed doors, it was unclear what representations Canada made, and the government would not reveal any details, including what its position is.\n\nMr. Salloum felt the fact Canada was not one of those countries reported to have raised serious concerns about the U.S.-India deal was telling, and signalled what he and other opponents of the deal have long feared, namely that Canada was supporting India.\n\n"The lack of decision, lack of consensus at this month''s NSG meeting is significant," he said. "What''s sad is that there were other countries that did [question the deal] and we could have been with them.\n\n"For this government to make decisions based on very, very narrow trade interests or very, very narrow filter vis-&agrave;-vis relations with the United States, is very short-sighted." \n\nIn addition, Mr. Salloum said it was unfortunate Marius Grinius, Canada''s ambassador on disarmament, was not representing Canadian interests. Foreign Affairs officials confirmed yesterday Mr. Grinius was not at the meeting.\n\n"I don''t think it''s inappropriate to have our Austrian ambassador there, obviously, because [Austria] was the host country," he said. "But given that the issues centred around non-proliferation...I would have hoped Mr. Grinius was playing an important role there, and it would have sent a message if Mr. Grinius was given the lead representative role for Canada at this meeting."\n\nErnie Regehr, co-founder of Project Ploughshares who has served as an advisor to Canadian governments on disarmament issues, also felt disappointed the government did not side with those countries that had raised concerns about the U.S.-India deal, as well as the fact Mr. Grinius was not Canada''s representative at the meeting.\n\n"That is surprising because this is a meeting which is addressing the most fundamental of non-proliferation rules," he said. "If you took the rule seriously, it would strike me that you send to the meeting those people who know its background, how it came into being and why it''s a very important non-proliferation rule, and at a minimum take huge care about the circumstances under which there might be an exemption to it."\n\n<i>lee@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'emerson_pmo-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0),(6015, '<b> Turkey Decries Toronto School Board Genocide Course</b>  \n', 'The killings of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 is being taught alongside the Holocaust and the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and the province''s Ministry of Education, the Turkish Embassy has voiced strong objections to a Toronto District School Board decision to teach students that the killing of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 was genocide.', 'In a letter to Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and the province''s Ministry of Education, the Turkish Embassy has voiced strong objections to a Toronto District School Board decision to teach students that the killing of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 was genocide.\n\n<div id="sidebar" style="width: 180px;"> <b>Furor Over High School Course Reached House in 1988</b>\n\nTwenty years ago, the debate surrounding the Ottawa Board of Education''s decision to refer to the killing of Armenians as Turkish genocide went all the way to the House of Commons.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister Joe Clark rose in the House on March 17, 1988 to say that one of his senior officials should not have interfered with the board''s decision and said an official apology would be sent.\n\nMr. Clark''s assistant deputy minister of the Europe branch, Jacques Roy, had sent a letter to the board criticizing the decision to characterize the 1915 mass killings of Armenians as genocide in a new high school course. Mr. Roy said it would affect relations between Turkey and Canada.\n\nMr. Clark told the House the letter had been sent without his knowledge and said the Department of External Affairs should not have been involved in the matter.\n\n</div>The lessons will come in a new course entitled "Genocide: Historical and Contemporary Implications" that will be launched with the start of the new school year in September. The course''s three case studies include the Ottoman''s killing of Armenians in 1915, the Holocaust and the 1994 Rwandan genocide. \n\nAlthough the Canadian Parliament approved a motion in 2004 recognizing the killings as genocide, the Turkish government has long disputed the description.\n\nThe idea of teaching a course on genocide was first raised three years ago by a Toronto board trustee, but has since been met with controversy on all sides. Aside from Turkish objections, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress advocated that the Holodomor should be included in the course, and the Muslim Canadian Congress accused the board of religious bias. \n\nAs the controversy escalated over what was and wasn''t included in course material, the school board decided earlier this year to strike a review committee. After a few public meetings, the panel concluded that the course reading list would need to be approved by a panel of historical experts.\n\nIt''s unclear how the Armenian killings were included in the Toronto school board course proposal, but the inclusion of one book in particular, <i>Extraordinary Evil: A Brief History of Genocide</i> by Barbara Coloroso, sparked outrage.\n\nAt one point the review committee had agreed to remove Ms. Coloroso''s book from its reading list, which in turn prompted outcry from the literary community and a letter from Penguin Canada president David Davidar to the school board defending Ms. Coloroso''s credentials as an educator.\n\nThis past June, after months of debate, committee and public review, the school board decided to include Ms. Coloroso''s book as a text examining the psychology of genocide, and on June 2 gave final approval for the course to go ahead in 11 Toronto high schools, reaching about 300 Grade 11 students.\n\n\n<b>Turkish Outrage</b>\n\nThat has prompted a backlash from the Turkish Embassy as well as members of the Turkish community.\n\n"This is a pedagogical thing and goes against traditional Canadian principles of objectivity, and this is a matter of history...which should really be immune to political pressures," said Yonet Tezel, first counsellor at the Turkish Embassy. "That''s something for Canadian educational institutions to consider themselves, we don''t need to remind them of that.\n\n"The school board''s decision to go ahead anyway and teach it as genocide, it''s very objectionable, that''s why Turkish parents are concerned, and I sympathize with them."\n\nMr. Tezel said the Turkish Embassy has communicated its concern to colleagues at the Department of Foreign Affairs and to provincial officials that as the school year commences, Turkish Ambassador Rafet Akg&uuml;nay will continue to raise his concerns through diplomatic channels.\n\nThe Council of Turkish Canadians has also expressed its disapproval, especially of the inclusion of <i>Extraordinary Evil.</i>\n\nLale Eskicioglu, executive director of the Council of Turkish Canadians, launched a formal complaint against the Toronto District School Board in November. Ms. Eskicioglu also started a petition, which she said has collected 12,000 signatures.\n\n"It cannot be taught as genocide," she said. "You can teach it as a dispute or under Ottoman history maybe, but you cannot teach it in the same category with Holocaust and Rwanda. This is a very serious crime. You cannot accuse a nation or its people of that which amounts to slander and hate propaganda because it''s not correct."\n\nFor Ms. Eskicioglu, this is a personal plight, and a situation in which she feels she and her fellow Turks have been wronged.\n\n"Why should my daughter, alongside with her Armenian friends, sit in the same classroom and hear one-sided inaccurate versions of history, which is categorized with the worst crime in the world?" Ms. Eskicioglu asked.\n\nAlthough the course has been approved, she said she plans to pursue the matter further, and that she and other parents will closely monitor the course teachings and materials used. Fearful that children of Turkish descent will face discrimination, Ms. Eskicioglu also said they are prepared to take legal action if any are bullied as a result of the teachings. \n\nThis past April, she said, posters accusing all Turkish people of being mass murderers were discovered pinned up around Carleton University''s campus in Ottawa.\n\n"This is our fight because these are our children," she said. "Please do not teach inaccurate history."\n\n\n<b>Course Overdue</b>\n\nBut those in support of the course and its inclusion of the Armenian killings as genocide say it is long overdue and that the inclusion of the course is part of living in a diverse and multicultural country such as Canada.\n\nLiberal MP Jim Karygiannis, who represents the Toronto riding of Scarborough-Agincourt and in 2005 travelled to Armenia to commemorate the Armenian genocide, expressed his support for the course at one of the school board''s special meetings in June.\n\nAlthough Mr. Karygiannis said the meeting was "cordial," he said he is disturbed that at least one protestor in turn verbally attacked him and his Greek ancestry.\n\n"The course is needed, we cannot bury our heads in the sand anymore," Mr. Karygiannis said Monday. "This is where we have to move on, we have to turn the page, we have to acknowledge what happened, we have to teach our children what happened."\n\nExecutive director of the Armenian National Committee of Canada, Aris Babikian, said there are several respected scholars who have concluded the Armenian killings to be genocide. \n\nOver the last several months, he said, the controversy has been fuelled by some members of the Turkish community misrepresenting some of the issues, and disputes that Turkish students will face discrimination or bullying.\n\n"The issue, it''s not to try to stigmatize certain segments in our society in Canada on the controversy, it''s something the students should [learn] from these past experiences and in the Turkish-Armenian case, it is the hype and paranoia of the Turkish government inflaming the issue here because they are getting involved in these issues," Mr. Babikian said. "We do not have any issue with the Turkish-Canadian community."\n\nSystem superintendent for special projects for the Toronto School Board Nadine Segal said that despite the controversy, school board officials feel very positive about the planned course and are confident they have knowledgeable teachers.

"We had to select areas that were well-resourced, that had materials that were available for high school students."\n\nShe said the course was built in alignment with the Ministry of Education''s policy for a locally-developed course, and involved input from community groups.\n\n"It''s very carefully constructed, also the main focus of the course is global citizenship and what students can do to respect human rights and prevent future genocides, so we expect students to be critical thinkers and do something with this information, and that''s where we move into the section of the course that focuses on social action."\n\n<i>mcollins@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n\n', 'The killings of 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 is being taught alongside the Holocaust and the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'turkey-8-27-2008', 1219809600, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6016, '<b> Flocking South for the Democratic Convention </b>  \n', 'With Obamamania hotter than ever, and a long-awaited election call widely expected next week in Ottawa, Canadian politicians have flocked to the Democratic National Convention in search of key connections and a few campaign pointers.', 'With Obamamania hotter than ever, and a long-awaited election call widely expected next week in Ottawa, Canadian politicians have flocked to the Democratic National Convention in search of key connections and a few campaign pointers.\n\nThe DNC, running from Aug. 25 to 28 in Denver, has attracted Canucks from across the political spectrum.\n\nThree senior ministers from the government camp made the Southern pilgrimage: Health Minister <b>Tony Clement</b>, House Leader <b>Peter Van Loan</b> and Transport Minister <b>Lawrence Cannon</b>, who also plays the role of Prime Minister <b>Stephen Harper</b>''s Quebec lieutenant. \n\nThe ministerial trio will benefit from the guidance of Canada''s well-connected ambassador to Washington, <b>Michael Wilson</b>. \n\nThe Liberals took a slightly different approach, sending south Foreign Affairs critic<b> Bob Rae</b> and party president <b>Doug Ferguson.</b>\n\nThe Liberal Party''s national director <b>Greg Fergus</b> was also slated to go, but didn''t make it down in the end.

It was without a UN mandate that NATO had intervened in the clash between Serbian security forces and Albanian separatist guerrillas in 1999. However, it was UN Resolution 1244 that brought a ceasefire to the disputed province, and although NATO troops were to replace Serb forces in providing security, Kosovo was to remain the sovereign territory of Serbia.\n\nIt was obvious that Harper''s Conservatives understood the implications of recognizing the secession of a province based on a unilateral declaration of independence by an ethnic majority of that territory as it took a full month for Canada to concede to recognition of the new state. The U.S. and the British had been the primary pilots steering Kosovo towards independence in this manner as they knew that Russia and China would block any further efforts to achieve a consensus on this issue through the official United Nations channels.\n\nUnder tremendous pressure from the U.S. State Department, Harper finally buckled and joined the small number of nations that had already recognized Kosovo''s independence. At that juncture, some three-dozen countries had followed the American lead, and despite George Bush''s best efforts, that number has topped out at just 46. A similar number of nations have rejected Kosovo''s independence outright and the remaining 100 UN members continue to sit on the fence. \n\nAt the time that Harper reluctantly agreed to recognize Kosovo, he claimed that this particular Balkan province was a "unique case" and therefore violating the UN charter, which deems national sovereignty to be inviolate, would not set any sort of precedent.\n\nAs witnessed by recent events in the Republic of Georgia, the breakaway territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia have wasted little time in proving Harper wrong. When the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s, three new countries&mdash;Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia&mdash;emerged in the strategically important region known as the Caucasus.\n\nWhile much of the Western media''s attention was focused on events in the violent breakup of Yugoslavia, an equally brutal series of wars was being conducted in this region. The end result was a number of unresolved frozen conflicts with sovereign territories occupied by belligerent nations&mdash;such as the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, which is still being held by Armenian troops&mdash;and regions such as South Ossetia and Abkhazia that refused to join Georgia when it separated from Russia. \n\nArmed with U.S. assurances and military aid, American-educated Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili decided on Aug. 7 to flex his muscles and attempt to exert control by force over South Ossetia. The Russians were not caught napping and they responded immediately and forcefully. The Georgian troops were hurled out of South Ossetia back into Georgian territory and Saakashvili immediately took to the airwaves to call upon the international community to save him from Russian aggression.\n\nBack in April at the NATO summit in Bucharest, it had been Canada and the U.S. who had pushed forcefully for Georgia''s inclusion into the alliance. Thankfully, the western European nations rejected both Georgia and Ukraine''s admission to NATO as they could unnecessarily provoke the Russians. Had Canada and the U.S. been successful, as a NATO member, Saakashvili''s cry for support would have plunged the alliance into a military showdown with Russia.\n\nIt has now become clear that the Russian bear may be reawakening in terms of military might, but their intention in the Caucasus seems limited to recognizing South Ossetia and Abkhazia as separate states&mdash;not re-occupying all of Georgia. What is hypocritical beyond belief is Bush and Condoleezza Rice claiming that by recognizing these two small states as independent, Russia is setting a dangerous precedent for others to ignore the UN charter. That would be the same UN charter that the U.S. ignored when it bombed Serbia in 1999, when they invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and when they invaded Iraq in 2003.\n\nCanada made a grave mistake in the recognition of Kosovo, and we should not be so quick to leap onboard the Bush bandwagon when it comes to determining a policy on the Georgian crisis.

It is normal for judges to give "significant deference" to such decisions.  But in a decision (Getkate v. the Minister of Public Safety) released on Aug. 25, Justice Michael Kelen pulled no punches and paid no "deference" to the minister.\n\nThe decision was rendered in response to a judicial review request made by a Canadian imprisoned in the United States whose request for transfer to a Canadian prison had been rejected twice by Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day.\n\nJustice Kelen, in his decision in favour of Arend Getkate, stated that the minister was "wholly unreasonable," that the "evidence points in a wholly opposite direction" to the decision and that the minister "unreasonably disregarded this evidence."\n\nOver 30 years ago, Canadian officials were successful in promoting at INTERPOL and the International Law Commission a concept for a new international treaty. The concept was for bilateral and multilateral treaties that would permit convicted prisoners to transfer to their country of citizenship and serve out their sentences within a familiar environment and close to family and friends.\n\nThe concept met an obvious need as, within a few years, there were numerous bilateral treaties and a multilateral one. The United States and Mexico were the first with a bilateral and Canada followed within a few months with its own treaty with the United States. The Council of Europe saw considerable merit in the concept and within a few years, in 1983, its member states agreed to a multilateral treaty in which all of its members could participate without needing to negotiate bilateral agreements.\n\nThe concept has stood the test of time and today there is an extensive network of such treaties and new bilaterals are signed every year. In the intervening years, in addition to the Council of Europe, both the Commonwealth and the Organization of American States have put in place their own treaties for the use of their members.\n\nThe concept and the treaties were not based on wide-eyed humanitarianism, although there is such an element in the results. Rather, the concept was based on the reality that Canadian citizens convicted in foreign countries had an absolute right to return to Canada following the completion of their sentences.  More often than not such persons would be deported direct to Canada. In those situations, once returned there was no criminal record registered in Canada, or sometimes there was not even knowledge of the crimes committed, nor was there any ability by Canadian authorities to assess the individual''s likelihood of re-offending or of being some measure of risk to Canadians.\n\nThe transfer treaties overcame these problems and, in the assessment of most countries, provided a valuable addition to inter. Transferred prisoners were incarcerated upon return and in doing so there was an opportunity for correctional officials to assess the individual and come to first-hand conclusions on the individual and the danger they might pose once released. \n\nIn the intervening years, Canada negotiated treaty arrangements with countries in all parts of the world, with an emphasis on those where Canadians are frequently arrested and imprisoned. Today there are arrangements with 76 countries, ranging from Albania to Zimbabwe.   \n\nBetween 1978, when Canada signed its first treaty with the United States, and 2005, more than 1,400 Canadians were transferred from foreign prisons to prisons in Canada. The vast majority were from prisons in the United States, but there were significant numbers from Costa Rica, Mexico, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago and the United Kingdom.  \n\nDuring those 27 years, only five were rejected for transfer by the then-Canadian solicitors general/ministers of public safety, a rejection rate of less that one-half of one percent.  While precise information is not available, these rejections were based largely on an inability to prove Canadian citizenship by the applicant. All governments during that period, Liberal and Conservative, understood and accepted the value of such transfers for Canada and Canadians and made decisions accordingly.\n\nIt became apparent with the arrival of the Harper government that Mr. Day had little understanding or sympathy for the well-tried concept of prisoner transfers.  From January 2006 to January 2008, 117 Canadians were accepted for transfer by Mr. Day, but he rejected 61.\n\nIn the cases for which information is available, Mr. Day used reasons such as the return of the Canadian threatens the safety of Canadians and the security of Canada, there was no evidence that the individual could be rehabilitated or that there was an "abandonment " of Canada by the applicant.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Getkate, who at the age of 12, in 1996, was taken to the United States by his mother and in 2002 was convicted of child molestation in Georgia, Justice Kelen summarily dismissed all three reasons for refusal as given by the minister. The judge forcibly stated that the minister''s decisions were inconsistent with the evidence presented to him by his officials, who on two occasions recommended that Mr. Getkate be transferred.\n\nJustice Kelen''s decision only has specific application to the case of Mr. Getkate, but there are many other Canadians who have been refused transfers by Mr. Day based on the same specious reasoning.   \n\nSome commentators have suggested that ideological reasons underpin Mr. Day''s approach and form part of the "tough on crime" approach of the current government.  It is equally apparent that the toughness of the approach is more illusory than real.  \n\nCertainly, in refusing to transfer Canadians from foreign prisons, the government is increasing the risk to Canadians when such persons return to Canada at the completion of their foreign sentences. We can hope that the clarity and reasonableness of Justice Kelen''s decision will lead the government to change its approach. Unfortunately, the fevered electoral atmosphere is not one where clarity and reasonableness prevails. \n\n<i>Gar Pardy retired from the foreign service in 2003 following 36 years at DFAIT, including 11 years as director-general of consular services.

But what makes him think Canadians want to save it? \n\nPolls repeatedly show that the majority of Canadians are opposed to this hunt and that a vast majority would not be at all upset if it were ended today.\n\nMr. Barry is concerned because European politicians&mdash;unlike their Canadian counterparts&mdash;are once again responding to their constituents. Belgium and the Netherlands have already imposed national import bans on seal products and other countries are following suit. Meanwhile, at the EU level, the Commission has recently released a proposal to ban trade in products from inhumane seal hunts.  \n\nIn its proposal, the Commission makes it pretty clear what it considers to be a humane hunt. Mr. Barry is incorrect when he claims that the "three-step process...conforms to existing Canadian standards." And cursory examination indicates that Canada''s commercial seal hunt would not qualify for derogation under the EU''s proposed criteria. \n\nCanada has had 50 years to bring its commercial seal hunt up to international animal welfare standards. It has failed, leading some experts to conclude that the hunt is inherently inhumane. The report of the European Food Safety Authority confirmed that there remains strong evidence that effective killing does not always occur in Canada''s commercial seal hunt and that animals continue to suffer pain and distress.\n\nIt must also be acknowledged that the major reason for the expansion of the seal hunt in the mid-1990s was neither "improved sales" nor "a dramatic increase in seal numbers," but rather a new direct subsidy program introduced by an ambitious fisheries minister named Brian Tobin. And the government still spends millions supporting this hunt even though the majority of Canadians consider this a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nAs a political scientist, Mr. Barry should understand that Canada''s commercial seal hunt continues today for one simple reason: politics. Every major national political party in the country supports it for fear of losing votes in Atlantic Canada. That will not change until one party realizes that by responding to national public opinion and opposing the seal hunt, it will gain more votes across the country than it will ever lose in Atlantic Canada. When that happens&mdash;as it inevitably will&mdash;Canada''s commercial seal hunt truly will become "endangered." \n\n\n<b>David Lavigne</b>\n\n<b>Science Advisor</b>\n\n<b>International Fund for Animal Welfare</b>\n\n<b>Guelph, Ont</b>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 13, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'letter5-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6044, '<b> Anti-Fur Groups Will Not be Si	lenced</b>  \n', 'It is difficult to understand how Donald Barry could be so wrong to claim the seafood boycott had no effect on fish sales ((Re: "How Canada Can Save Its Endangered Seal Hunt," Aug.', 'It is difficult to understand how Donald Barry could be so wrong to claim the seafood boycott had no effect on fish sales ((Re: "How Canada Can Save Its Endangered Seal Hunt," Aug. 20).

Anyone who has read Indian newspapers knows that such feelings are prevalent, mainly because a section of the Indian population feels the deal is an attempt to impinge on their sovereign space.\n\n"What the world, led by America, is trying to do," says Mr. Akbar over a cup of coffee at an Ottawa hotel last week, "is to give India some form of a semi-pariah status in the nuclear club."\n\nAs the oldest nuclear power outside the Big Five (Britain, U.S., France, Russia and China), Mr. Akbar feels the deal is patronizing and India is being arm-twisted into joining a club where it will still not get full rights. Or, as he put it, "It''s like a minority getting membership in a majority club, but only visiting rights, no dining rights."\n\nIn 2006, India and the U.S. signed a deal that recognizes India as a de facto nuclear power, despite the fact that it is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Under the deal, the U.S. will supply India with nuclear technology and fuel. India will be prohibited from selling nuclear technology to countries that have not signed the NPT. Despite the fact the deal stipulates India will be under strict observation from the International Atomic Energy Agency, it has still raised the ire of anti-nuclear activists, who argue that there are no guarantees India will not sell technology to non-signatories of the NPT or cease nuclear testing, and that only 14 of its 22 nuclear reactors will be under the international monitoring microscope.\n\nThe nuclear deal with the U.S is, however, not final pending scrutiny and approval by the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the U.S. Congress. Talks with the NSG, a group of countries opposed to proliferation, are currently underway in Vienna, with a deadline envisaged for this week, although there are hints they could drag on until next week.\n\nFor Akbar, the deal has hints of giving India nuclear legitimacy, which he contends is nonsense since India is a nuclear power in its own right. If it implies that India is seen as a more "responsible" nuclear power than say Iran and China, Mr. Akbar says no one has a right to issue that judgement, since it unmasks double standards employed by the Big Five ("those who hold the copyright to destroy the world," as he describes them).\n\n"I believe that either there should be no nuclear weapons in the world or whoever can make them should have them," he says.  "What law says that China or America are more responsible than India?"\n\nWhen it comes to the belief that some nations are responsible nuclear powers and others are not, Mr. Akbar believes this discussion masks the real issues that need to be discussed. In his opinion, this issue is the Big Five''s contribution to nuclear proliferation in the world.\n\n"Nobody will talk about the fact that Israel is a nuclear weapons state. Where does it get its uranium from, where does it get its technology from? Britain and France supplied it," he says.\n\n"What are they talking about North Korea for? Double standards is putting it mildly."\n\nThe regional implication of the U.S.-India deal is that it enhances a contiguous nuclear crescent that involves Israel, India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia and China. The important thing to note about this is the fact that this region contains 70 to 80 per cent of the world''s energy resources, and Mr. Akbar says this has serious implications for nuclear security. He believes the region will be re-ordered&mdash;the Georgia versus South Ossetia conflict is the beginning of the story-&mdash;as members of the Big Five try to win over countries to their spheres of influence.\n\nAs for the implications for nuclear security in the region, Mr. Akbar asks the rhetorical question: "Can a nation that is eight time zones away maintain security in Georgia?" \n\nAfter Iraq, Mr. Akbar says, U.S power has eroded significantly and he doubts whether it will have the capacity to maintain security in the region.\n\n "Samson should never have a haircut," he says with a chuckle.\n\nRegarding proliferation, Mr. Akbar says if he had an opportunity to speak to the Big Five, he would ask them to talk from the same page.\n\n"If you have a right to nuclear weapons, why would India not have a right? What is it that makes China so special in your eyes?"\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 26, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'lunch-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6046, '<b> Do They Want Us to Support Their Democracy?</b>  \n', 'In late June 2008, 2,150 Indonesians were asked by one of Indonesia''s most reputable polling firms, Lembaga Survey Indonesia (LSI), about their opinions on democracy and the role of outsiders in Indonesia''s democratic development.', 'In late June 2008, 2,150 Indonesians were asked by one of Indonesia''s most reputable polling firms, Lembaga Survey Indonesia (LSI), about their opinions on democracy and the role of outsiders in Indonesia''s democratic development. This was the first time that a survey in Indonesia or anywhere had asked what people thought of foreigners working on <i>their </i>democracy. \n\nDemocracy support or democracy assistance is an accepted, if at times controversial, part of international development.  Billions of dollars are spent each year by donor countries to strengthen democratic institutions such as parliaments, civil society organizations, or electoral commissions in developing countries around the world. Canada alone spends almost $500-million supporting democracy in other countries and has promised to publicize a whole-of- government policy to democracy assistance. This policy statement was due in May 2008 but has yet to materialize.\n\nIn all the deliberations over how Canada or other donors support democracy, the individuals meant to benefit from this assistance, namely the citizens in those countries where these programs are implemented, are rarely if ever consulted. This is not only ironic, but it threatens to condemn such initiatives to failure. Democracy needs to be built from the ground-up and led by the people in the countries where it is being established.    \n\nObservers of democracy support initiatives have in fact warned of a public backlash against programs led from the outside. This backlash stems mainly from the perceived double-standards of some donors, who are seen to support democracy in some countries while turning a blind eye to friendly authoritarian regimes in other countries. \n\nDespite this warning, very little is actually known about the public demand for foreign democracy support in developing countries. Increasingly sophisticated public opinion polls show that people in developing countries generally want more democracy.  The question that remains is: Do they necessarily want it from us?  The LSI poll is the first time that data is available that offers a cautious "yes" in response.   \n\nIndonesia is often held up as an example of successful democratic development. Next year, it will have its fourth presidential elections since the end of the Suharto regime in 1998, no small feat for a multi-ethnic country spread over two million square kilometres and 17,500 islands. It is the largest Muslim country in the world and is often presented behind India and the United States as the third-largest democracy in the world. As a result, it has in the last 10 years become an important destination for international democracy-support initiatives.  \n\nDespite its advances, Indonesia''s democratization cannot be taken for granted.  Corruption remains rife.  Rising oil and food prices have had a devastating effect on the more than 40 per cent of Indonesians who live on less than $2 a day. In May, violent confrontations between youth linked to different political parties raised serious concerns about next year''s elections. It is not surprising then that many of Indonesia''s foremost democratic reformers have warned that democracy in Indonesia is in fact failing. \n\nHowever, conclusions on Indonesia''s democratic development may need to be more nuanced, as illustrated by the findings from the June 2008 LSI survey. The poll showed that 74 per cent of Indonesians still think that democracy remains the best form of government, and 68 per cent of Indonesians feel Indonesia is already a democracy, even if it could use improvement.\n\nMoreover, while 52 per cent claimed that a democracy should be left to improve on its own without outside support, 48 per cent of Indonesians felt that a country can use international assistance to improve its democracy.  When asked about Indonesia specifically, 43 per cent of Indonesians actually welcomed the help of other countries to improve their democracy, compared to 33 per cent who do not see a role for outsiders.  \n\nFinally, when asked which countries or institutions they would like to assist Indonesia''s democracy, the United States was the respondents'' third preferred choice (15 per cent), compared to "a Muslim country" (33 per cent) and the United Nations (23 per cent).  Canada was hardly on the radar, selected by only 0.4 per cent of respondents.  \n\nWhat tentative conclusions can be drawn from these findings?  First, Indonesia''s democrats should be heartened, as Indonesians may well have more confidence in Indonesia''s development as a democracy than they are given credit for. \n\nSecond, foreign providers of democracy assistance should be reassured by the fact that many Indonesians seem to accept a role, even if cautiously, for outsiders in supporting Indonesia''s democratic development.  \n\nThird, while the public backlash against foreign democracy assistance in Indonesia may not be as broad and deep as feared, the poll''s results should not be interpreted as unqualified support for unilateral foreign democracy assistance. Fully one-third of respondents were against any role for outsiders. One way to change this view might be for democracy support programs to be supported collaboratively by donors, the United Nations and other democratizing Muslim countries. \n\nThere are also words of warning in the poll''s findings. When the data is disaggregated, young urban Indonesians are shown to be more skeptical about Indonesia''s democratization or even hostile to the role of foreigners. Recent history in Indonesia and elsewhere&mdash;think Kenya in January 2008&mdash;shows that disenfranchised young people living in urban areas can become dangerous tools in politically charged situations, such as election periods.  \n\nFollowing the tragic election violence in Kenya earlier this year, this newspaper lamented that supporting democracy is "a messy business" and that the Government of Canada had "better know what it''s getting itself into." (<i>Embassy</i>, Jan. 9, 2008).  \n\nThe LSI poll shows that one way to perhaps do that is to simply ask what people actually think about this whole endeavour.  \n\n<i>Michael Wodzicki is a Walter and Duncan Gordon Foundation Global Youth Fellow (2007-2008) and deputy director of policy, programs and planning at Rights &amp; Democracy. </i>\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 12, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'wodzicki-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6047, '<b> Conservatives Get Iraqi-Style Plug on Election Eve</b>  \n', 'Have you seen the new campaign-style ad the Conservatives released last week?

The third was Conservative MP <b>Rob Merrifield</b>, co-chair of the Canada-United States Inter-Parliamentary Group.\n\nThe only Liberal who flew south is inter-parliamentary group member and Liberal MP <b>John McKay</b>, who told <i>Chatter House</i><b> </b>he was excited to be attending the "second-most important political event of the year."\n\nMr. McKay, a Toronto-area MP, admitted he was "Democratically inclined" and would be paying close attention to buzz about the tactics behind negative advertising.\n\nLike the Republicans, he charged, the Conservatives have both "scandalous amounts of money" to "paper the airwaves" and few scruples about smearing their opponents.\n\n\n<b>Georgia/Russia Update</b>\n\nTensions between Canada and Russia rose this week as Foreign Minister <b>David Emerson</b> and his G7 counterparts gave Russia a joint tongue-lashing. \n\n"Russia''s recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and is contrary to UN Security Council Resolutions supported by Russia," the ministers said. "Russia''s decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the Caucasus."\n\nOuch.\n\nBut bilateral relations haven''t fallen completely off the rails. \n\nShowing things aren''t completely iced over, DFAIT''s deputy director for Russia, Central Asia and the Caucasus <b>Gilles Breton</b> made an appearance at the Russian Embassy last week. See <i>Party Time</i> (page 15) for more.\n\nMeanwhile, Liberal Senator <b>Jerry Grafstein</b> had lunch with Georgian Vice Prime Minister <b>Giorgi Baramidze</b> at the Democratic National Convention in Denver last week.\n\nSenator Grafstein said he was the first Canadian to visit Georgia after it gained independence in 1994, has addressed the country''s parliament, and has supervised two elections in the country.\n\nHe said he is working to put together a group of international parliamentarians&mdash;Canadians, Americans, Scandinavians and others&mdash;to travel to Georgia to observe hostilities.\n\nHe added that he supports both the opening of a Canadian embassy in Georgia, as well as the signing of a free trade agreement with the country.\n\nWhile support is building for an embassy in Tbilisi, DFAIT isn''t so keen.\n\n"We have no immediate plans to establish a Canadian Embassy in Tbilisi," said DFAIT spokesman <b>Alain Cacchione</b> last week.\n\n<i>jdavis@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 30, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'chatterhouse-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6048, '<b> Foreign Policy To Be Blinkered Once Again </b>  \n', 'With every sign indicating that Canadians are going to be heading to the polls in mid-October, those diplomats who were hoping foreign policy would make some sort of appearance on the Canadian election trail are almost certainly in for disappointment.', 'With every sign indicating that Canadians are going to be heading to the polls in mid-October, those diplomats who were hoping foreign policy would make some sort of appearance on the Canadian election trail are almost certainly in for disappointment.\n\nIf you were to ask an experienced Canadian political historian when the last time foreign policy was an important part of an election here in the Great White North, you''d probably get a few guesses.\n\nThe first, in recent history, would be in 1988, which revolved around the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (later superseded by the North American Free Trade Agreement). Incumbent Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney had signed the deal earlier in the year. The Liberals and NDP were opposed, but the PCs managed to hang on to power, though they did lose seats.\n\nHowever, historians are torn over whether arguing over a free trade agreement with the United States can really be considered a foreign policy issue. The consensus appears to be that it had more to do with domestic politics and the economy.\n\nThe same argument can be made for the 1993 election, which saw the PCs and Liberals go head-to-head over NAFTA, though it was not nearly as important to the election outcome as the original Canada-U.S. deal had been.\n\nFrom there, one has to go back several decades to 1963. That February, Canada was embroiled in a major debate over whether American nuclear-tipped anti-aircraft missiles should be allowed on Canadian soil to protect against the threat of Soviet bombers.\n\nThat debate actually toppled John Diefenbaker''s government, and is considered the one time a foreign policy issue precipitated the fall of a Canadian government.\n\nUndoubtedly there have been other times when a foreign policy question figured in the campaign and final results. Former prime minister Joe Clark''s promise in 1979 to move the Canadian embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was successfully used as an example of his inexperience (though it was not the only reason he lost the 1980 election). Wars, of course, also provide for much debate, as evidenced by the conscription crisis in 1917.\n\nYet the point is that, by and large, foreign policy does not figure prominently into Canadian elections, if at all, and this coming campaign is likely to bear that truism out.\n\nThere are two potential foreign policy issues that one would think would be extremely pressing to Canadians as they prepare to elect what will in all likelihood be another minority government: Afghanistan and the environment.\n\nThe Conservative government inherited Canada''s war in Afghanistan from the Liberals, and have really made it their own. Yet the government''s policies on Afghanistan for the first two years of its mandate were extremely divisive, and opinion polls continually showed the majority of Canadians wanted out, if not immediately, then by February 2009.\n\nOf course, the whole question of Canadian involvement in Afghanistan was put to rest in March with the Liberals and Conservatives voting together to extend the mission to 2011. Not only did the extension all but take Afghanistan off the public''s radar, it also left the Liberals unable to fight any election on it. So expect little mention of Canada''s newest war over the next month and a half, except maybe from the NDP and Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois.\n\nThat leaves the environment. \n\nThe whole world knows Canada''s position on fighting climate change is suspect under this government. Heaps of criticism, scorn and condemnation have been piled onto the Conservative plan, which has taken Canada''s reputation with it. Canadians will say they care, but the sad reality is that they don''t really think about it that much.\n\nMeanwhile, yes, this election will be about the environment, kind of. But it won''t be, really. It''s going to be about taxes. The Green Shift is about taxes. Taxes to save the environment, the Liberals contend. Taxes to ruin the economy, the Conservatives shoot back.\n\nEither way, the debate over the environment and climate change that is going to take place in Canada isn''t going to be about the country''s role in helping the world tackle this 21<sup>st</sup> century problem. It''s not going to be about fulfilling its international commitments. It''s going to be about taxes to do something, or not taxes to do nothing.\n\nNone of this is likely surprising. The majority of elections around the world revolve around domestic issues blinkered from the global environment. Which is unfortunate because more than ever domestic and foreign issues are woven together for a nation''s long-term good or bad health.\n\n\n', '', NULL, 4, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'editorial-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0);INSERT INTO `story` (`story_id`, `story_title`, `story_brief`, `story_content`, `story_kicker`, `story_cutline`, `story_section_id`, `story_section_heading_id`, `story_super_section_id`, `story_front_page`, `story_order`, `story_url_id`, `story_issue_date`, `story_status`, `story_updated`, `story_lock_current_issue`, `story_lock_archives`, `story_hit_view`, `story_hit_email`, `story_hit_blog`) VALUES (6049, '<b> Change: The Nature of the Evidence </b>  \n', 'If Hurricane Gustav had struck New Orleans with full force, what would that have told us about the scale and speed of climate change?

What should people accept as evidence? And what will they accept in practice?\n\nFor scientists, the most persuasive evidence that global warming is happening faster than the models predict is the accelerating loss of Arctic sea-ice. The National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, which tracks the summer melt season each year, calculates that the loss of ice cover in the Arctic Ocean has already exceeded that of 2005, the second-worst year since observations began, and may surpass last year''s record low.\n\nThis is not only bad news for polar bears, since an ice-covered Arctic Ocean reflects most incoming sunlight back into space while open water, being darker, absorbs most of the sun''s heat instead. An ice-free Arctic Ocean changes the world''s heat balance and causes faster warming.\n\nIn the last 20 years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the ice cover shrank each year from an average of 14 million square kilometres in late winter to about 7 million sq. km. in late September. Last year''s low was only 4 million sq. km., and this year looks likely to be about the same. This is the kind of evidence that grabs scientists by the throat&mdash;but it barely gets anybody else''s attention at all.\n\nOnly a couple of years ago, the climate models suggested that we might see a completely ice-free Arctic Ocean in late summer by the 2040. Now some experts are speculating that we might get there as soon as 2013. But a thousand stories have been written about Hurricane Gustav for every one that is written about what is happening in the Arctic.\n\nThat''s understandable, because not one in a thousand human beings has ever seen the Arctic Ocean close up. Nobody is being evacuated because of this accelerating disaster, and so the media virtually ignores it. Whereas for a few days early this week, we were inundated with stories about the threat posed to New Orleans by Hurricane Gustav only three years after the city was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nIf you include all the "missing" people whose bodies were never found, about two and a half thousand Americans were killed by Katrina. The incompetence of the federal government''s response made the event even more shocking to a nation that had come to think that this kind of natural disaster only happened to places like Honduras or Bangladesh, so it''s not surprising that President Bush cancelled his planned speech at the Republican National Convention at the last minute. The last thing John McCain''s campaign needed was a living reminder of that blunder.\n\nHowever, the main impact of Katrina was to break a great many people out of their denial that climate change was a problem. The big shift in American public opinion over the following 18 months owed much to Al Gore''s film <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>, but for many Americans who would never believe a word Al Gore said, Katrina was the moment when the denial stopped.\n\nYet the truth is that Hurricane Katrina could have happened at any time in the past 50 years. In any of those years it would have produced the same results, assuming the same degree of human incompetence, because the flood defences of New Orleans had been inadequate for a long time.  The climate change models predict more intense hurricanes, but not necessarily more of them&mdash;and Katrina was only category three on a scale that goes up to five.\n\nKatrina hit in just the right place, and exposed the vulnerability of New Orleans. Hurricane Gustav, another category three storm, missed it and struck less populated areas which, this time, had been mostly evacuated.  But if it had been Katrina II, it would have done more than a thousand stories about shifting rainfall patterns, acidifying oceans and melting ice to persuade people that climate change is a real threat to their well-being. Even though it was just a hurricane, and may have had nothing to do with global warming.\n\nThe regrettable reality is that there will not be a critical mass of people willing to act decisively on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the developed countries&mdash;where most of the cuts must be made&mdash;until some really big natural disaster kills a lot of people IN ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES.\n\nIt doesn''t necessarily have to be a disaster caused by climate change (although it probably will be), because most people don''t understand enough about the climate to know what is valid evidence for climate change and what is not. Katrina helped to move Americans from denial to acceptance that global warming is a problem, but it will take an even bigger disaster to persuade them to act decisively.\n\n<i>editor@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 3, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'dyer-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6050, '<b> Baker Looks Back on Positive, Negative Changes</b>  \n', 'While thrilled that bilateral relations have improved at "an amazing pace" thanks to Prime Minister <b>Stephen Harper</b>, outgoing Israeli Ambassador <b>Alan Baker</b> says he is disheartened that he has seen an increasing anti-Israeli sentiment brewing across Canada.', 'While thrilled that bilateral relations have improved at "an amazing pace" thanks to Prime Minister <b>Stephen Harper</b>, outgoing Israeli Ambassador <b>Alan Baker</b> says he is disheartened that he has seen an increasing anti-Israeli sentiment brewing across Canada.\n\nMr. Baker is widely known as an outspoken and active diplomat, and he says that throughout his travels, and particularly when giving lectures at universities across Canada, he has noticed a greater amount of opposition towards and criticism of his country.\n\n"When I first arrived [in 2004] people would ask questions and things were more or less civil," Mr. Baker says. "As time has gone by, the ways in which these groups are functioning has become more outspoken and to the border of violence, and I think universities here in Canada, they don''t know how to deal with it."\n\nMr. Baker says the worrying development is due in part to a Muslim and left-wing attempt to "take over the political agenda" on campuses and "abuse" the openness and freedom of the Canadian university system. While acknowledging there are those who feel Mr. Harper shouldn''t be supporting Israel, Mr. Baker believes everyone is entitled to their viewpoint as long as it is based on information that is accurate and correct.\n\nHe says Israel is misrepresented and criticized by Canada''s major media outlets too often, and one way he tries to diffuse negative perceptions is by responding in print and on television. With good humor, Mr. Baker says his op-ed and letter submissions to some newspapers were so frequent that editors became familiar contacts.\n\nBut while there may be more anti-Israeli feelings in some elements of Canadian society, Mr. Baker says, the areas of diplomacy, security, technology, military equipment and agriculture have borne witness to a positive shift from the past.\n\nMystified at the stagnant relations Israel had with Canada under Liberal prime minister Jean Chr&eacute;tien, Mr. Baker says siding with Israel isn''t about taking a simply pro-Israeli stance, it is standing by a fellow democratic country that is also involved in the war on terror.\n\n"Canada and Israel have always been friendly countries, but the previous governments, especially under Chr&eacute;tien, nevertheless retained a sort of reserved stance," Mr. Baker says. "I think this [current] government has moved away from that, and I think it''s a more genuine and principled approach."\n\nMr. Baker points to Canada''s voting record at the United Nations as an example of the improving relations, and dismisses the notion that this is a surprising or unusual move on the part of Canada. \n\n"I think it''s only natural and I was surprised that beforehand Canada, which has so much in common with Israel, would go along with some automatic majority or would abstain rather than do what, in my opinion, was the right thing to do," Mr. Baker says. "Canada doesn''t just sit on the fence anymore as it used to, but takes a principled position, and it''s a principled position, not pro-Israel but pro-the UN and for the good of international peace and security, and I think that''s very important and very worthy."\n\nHe speaks highly of the prize-winning wines Israel''s vineyards are producing, of the Israeli chip used in Blackberries, and of the water-related technology Israel has mastered, and from which Alberta''s prairies hope to benefit.\n\nAs relations have improved, Mr. Baker says he is also very happy to see the 11-year-old free trade agreement between Israel and Canada is finally being optimized, and he is pleased at the increased number of cultural exchanges between the two countries.\n\nOf all the exchanges developed over the years, however, there remains one that escaped Mr. Baker, despite his best efforts&mdash;Mr. Harper paying an official visit to Israel.\n\nPlans had been made for Mr. Harper to visit Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories in late June, but at the last minute, Canadian officials cancelled the trip. Officials in the PMO said Mr. Harper''s visit would have coincided with a scheduled confidence vote in the Knesset, putting Israel''s minority government at risk, and likely overshadowing Mr. Harper''s visit. \n\n"Yes, that''s a disappointment," Mr. Baker says of the trip cancellation. "The dream of every ambassador is to accompany the prime minister to his country, and here my dream was frustrated, but I realize there were problems."\n\nAmong the more difficult moments he''s faced during his tenure in Ottawa, Mr. Baker says, the most trying was during the war between Israel and Hezbollah in the summer of 2006. \n\n"It was very, very difficult for me as a father&mdash;two of my sons were literally in the army, they''d been called up and were in Lebanon&mdash;so it was very hard to conduct day-to-day sort of life, and to run from the CBC to CTV and to be interviewed almost every day, and at the same time you don''t know where your kids are and what''s happening to them."\n\nSo nerve-racking was it that Mr. Baker''s wife <b>Dalia</b> went back to Israel to be at home in case something happened, while Mr. Baker says he found solace by ducking into churches between urgent appointments to take in that year''s edition of the Chamber Music Festival.\n\nBefore coming to Canada, Mr. Baker was a legal adviser to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs and actively involved in Middle East peace negotiations. Now, Mr. Baker and his wife will return to Israel together and wait for his next appointment from the Israeli government. The couple have three sons, aged 24, 32 and 33, one of whom will remain in Ottawa working as a chef at a hotel.\n\n<i>mcollins@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 5, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'dipcircles-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6051, '<b>Ottawa Cultural Listings</b>  \n', '<i>Submit your Ottawa-based event to listings@embassymag.ca or fax to 613-232-9055 by Friday at 5p.m.</i>\n\n\n<b>WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3</b>\n\n\nThe <b>State of Qatar</b> celebrates its Independence Day.', '<i>Submit your Ottawa-based event to listings@embassymag.ca or fax to 613-232-9055 by Friday at 5p.m.</i>\n\n\n<b>WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 3</b>\n\n\nThe <b>State of Qatar</b> celebrates its Independence Day.

At those meetings they have continually pressed Canada''s role in a prosperous American economy, including the importance of a hassle-free border that facilitates trade, rather than hindering it.\n\nMessrs. Merrifield and Grafstein said the decision to have Canadian and American officials devise a new border plan took off after they met with Ms. Pelosi in Washington, D.C., in April.\n\nMr. Grafstein said Ms. Pelosi "understood the Canadian issues" and got behind the idea of a new bipartisan plan for the border, developed in co-operation with Canadian politicians. The plan will be presented to Ms. Pelosi, who is expected to pass it onto the new administration regardless of its political stripe.\n\nMs. Pelosi has delegated the leadership of the project to Democratic New York Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, who has been working closely with Messrs. Merrifield and Grafstein. At last week''s Democratic National Convention, Ms. Slaughter arranged a series of meetings with top Democrats on the issue for the visiting Canadians.\n\n"[Ms. Slaughter] and I have been charged by Nancy Pelosi to put together a group to deal with border issues, and I do think there is an opportunity to have a re-examination of how the border has thickened and to [find] an appropriate position moving forward," Mr. Merrifield said from Denver last week. "On the Republican and Democratic sides both, there are some serious concerns."\n\nMr. Grafstein said this is a rare and valuable opportunity to get Canadian perspectives into the new plan at the ground floor.\n\n"This is the first time we''ve actually had an opportunity to bilaterally deal with border issues, rather than one country doing something unilaterally," he said. "That''s very positive."\n\nMessrs. Merrifield and Grafstein predicted that the plan will make an impression regardless of who wins the American presidency.\n\n"I believe there is an opportunity with the new administration, whether it''s McCain or Obama, and we''re working very hard to make sure that happens," said Mr. Merrifield. "I believe cool heads will prevail with trade. Americans are free traders by nature."\n\nThe border plan will be discussed further later this month is Washington, D.C., when Canadian and American legislators will convene for the annual meeting of the Canada-U.S. Border Alliance.\n\nMr. Grafstein said he is also pushing for a visit by Ms. Slaughter and other American legislators to Ottawa in late October or early November to discuss the plan. Among the invitees to this northern get-together is former Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.\n\n<b>"</b>I think [the border plan] will be a tremendous influence," said Mr. Grafstein. "When the speaker of the House asks for a plan to be implemented by the new administration, you should take that very seriously. And we do."\n\n\n<b>Change in the Air at DHS</b>\n\nMany Canada-U.S. watchers agree that the end of the Bush administration heralds in a new opportunity to reshape the organization blamed for many of the policies that have mucked up the border since 9/11: the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nGeorge W. Bush created the DHS in November 2002, combining 22 government agencies into a single organization. The organization now has over 200,000 employees, an annual operating budget of more than $44 billion, and works on trade, immigration, counterterrorism and many other files.\n\nMore than six years after its creation, though, many doubt its effectiveness and efficiency and see the departure of Mr. Bush as a chance to shake things up.\n\n"[The Department of] Homeland Security has been the cause of a lot of our problems," said Mr. Grafstein. "And the good news is that both the Democrats and Republicans are unhappy with Homeland Security."\n\nMr. Grafstein added that two top-ranking members of Congress on the homeland security file&mdash;California Democrat Loretta Sanchez and Ohio Republican George Voinovich&mdash;both agree changes are necessary. \n\n"We''re trying to develop a bipartisan approach to reforming Homeland Security in such a way that it minimizes the impact on the border with Canada," he said.\n\nA Canadian diplomat who recently left a high-ranking post at the Canadian Embassy in Washington also smells change in the air.\n\n"It wouldn''t surprise me if there was some significant change to the DHS because there''s a sense, particularly in Congress, that it just isn''t working and that big is not necessarily more efficient," he said. \n\n"The Democrats may well dismantle DHS and put something else in place."\n\nThe diplomat added that the change in administration will see the departure of current Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.\n\n"For one, you get rid of that awful current secretary of homeland security who is a real block for us," the diplomat said. "I''m afraid with Mr. Chertoff, he''s just been intransigent. We''ve not been able to make any progress."\n\nMr. Grafstein said he also welcomed the coming change of the homeland security secretary.\n\n"A key factor for us is who is going to be the next security advisor," he said.

He did say, however: "One in particular would be good for us. The other doesn''t know a lot about Canada."\n\n\n<b>Canadian Suggestions So Far</b>\n\nAt the request of his American allies, Mr. Grafstein has drawn up a series of preliminary recommendations about what can be done to achieve a better-managed border.\n\nA letter, containing eight points, was prepared at the request of Republican Senator and former governor of Ohio George Voinovich on July 31 and later passed to Ms. Slaughter.\n\nMr. Grafstein''s recommendations touch on points that would ease the flow of both people and goods across the border, and apply to air travel, trucking regulations and infrastructure.\n\nTo address trucking snags, he recommends lower inspection rates for members of trusted-shipper programs, such as the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) system, and that an agreement be put in place so "that rail and truck cargo inspected, cleared and secured at a Canadian port should not be subject to further inspections at the U.S. border."\n\nOn the air travel side, the senator recommends that the United States accept Canadian baggage screening as equivalent to U.S. standards so Canadian baggage being transferred in the U.S. does not have to be re-screened. \n\nIn addition, Mr. Grafstein requests U.S. authorities address the problem of understaffing at border crossings, with the assertion that major border crossings are lacking as much as 40 per cent of their required American staff.\n\nHe also asks for "continued U.S. priority attention" to the Detroit River International Crossing, where the Ambassador Bridge now connects Detroit, Michigan with Windsor, Ontario. This bridge currently carries some 25 per cent of total Canadian-American trade. To cope with congestion, Mr. Grafstein encourages his American counterparts to proceed with the construction of a second bridge or tunnel.\n\nFinally, Mr. Grafstein asks for continued co-operation in the run up to the June 1, 2009 full implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), which will require Canadian and U.S. citizens to use passports when crossing land and sea borders. The American public, he writes, must be made aware of the need for passports so as to stop any further drop in tourist traffic, which "which has substantially reduced in the last five years because of delays and additional documentation.\n\n<i>jdavis@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n\n', 'Jerry Grafstein and Rob Merrifield have been working with Louise Slaughter to devise a strategy for the next U.S. administration.\n', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 2, 'border_plan-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0),(6053, '<b> Biden, Palin Good News For Canada </b>  \n', 'To hear the two co-chairs of the Canada-\r\nU.S. Inter-Parliamentary Friendship\r\nGroup tell it,\r\nCanada is in\r\nfor a smooth ride no\r\nmatter which presidential\r\ncandidate wins\r\nthis Novemberâ€™s U.S.\r\npresidential elections\r\nthanks to their respective\r\nchoices for running\r\nmate.', 'To hear the two co-chairs of the Canada-U.S. Inter-Parliamentary Friendship Group tell it, Canada is in for a smooth ride no matter which presidential candidate wins this November''s U.S. presidential elections thanks to their respective choices for running mate.\n\n"From the perspective of Canada, we''re in great shape either way with either one of these prospective vice-presidents or running mates," said Conservative MP and friendship group co-chair Rob Merrifield last week. "I think they understand the relationship with Canada and we will do everything we can to work with them in a positive way and impact them in a positive way to address the concerns we may have."\n\nOn Aug. 27, Delaware Senator Joe Biden officially accepted his nomination as running mate to the Democrat''s presidential candidate, Barack Obama. Two days later, Republican candidate John McCain surprised everyone by naming Alaska Governor Sarah Palin his running mate.\n\nMr. Biden''s nomination was felt to bring a number of key strengths to the Democratic ticket, including a bevy of experience on foreign affairs as the senator had served, on and off, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations since 2001.\n\nYet with it came concerns in Canada that Mr. Biden would be, in the words of the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, the Democrat''s "attack dog on trade." Mr. Biden has said he is a supporter of fair trade, not free trade, and he has voted against several free trade agreements in the U.S. Senate. That reputation, combined with Mr. Obama''s comments earlier this year on renegotiating NAFTA, have created jitters in some parts of Canada.\n\nYet Liberal Senator Jerry Grafstein, who co-chairs the Inter-Parliamentary  Friendship Group with Mr. Merrifield, describes Biden as a "great friend of Canada."\n\nMr. Grafstein, who has known Mr. Biden for 15 years and met with the Delaware senator after he accepted the vice-presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Denver last Wednesday, said Canadians have no need to worry.\n\nHe said Mr. Obama is unaware of the positive impact NAFTA has on the American economy, especially his home state of Illinois, because the presidential candidate has worked on social issues, not economics, during his political career.\n\n"So we have to give him an education," he said. "The good news on the other side is his running mate is a great friend of Canada.... He knows the border issues very well. He knows foreign policy very, very well. He''s a good liberal democrat when it comes to foreign policy."\n\nThe problem, however, is that Democrats are increasingly in favour of withdrawing from the world and becoming more isolationist, Mr. Grafstein said. At the same time, Democrats are more likely to work with America''s allies, as opposed to moving unilaterally, he added. \n\n"He understands these issues very well. So we will have, I hope, a balancing voice in the White House on issues affecting Canada, and issues affecting multilateralism," Mr. Grafstein said. "That''s good news for us."\n\nWhen it comes to Ms. Palin, the fact that her state is the only one that borders both Canada and Russia is being used as a way to bolster her suspect foreign policy credentials.\n\n"I met her in Juneau [Alaska] last year and was impressed with her then. Because her state borders two countries she has a different perspective that the lower 48 doesn''t get," the <i>Congressional Quarterly</i> quoted former U.S. ambassador to the United National John Bolton as saying of Ms. Palin this weekend.\n\nAt the same time, the revelation she was responsible for awarding a major pipeline contract to a Canadian company earlier in the summer has netted favourable nods.\n\nMr. Merrifield said he first met Ms. Palin at a conference for western U.S. state governors and felt Canada will benefit immensely if she becomes vice-president under a McCain administration.\n\n"[Canada is] totally in her radar," he said. "Alaskans feel closer to Canada than perhaps the rest of the United States because of geography and isolationist, being so far north. They understand Canada much better. When I''m up in Alaska, it''s like talking to your colleagues."\n\nMr. Merrifield said Ms. Palin is particularly on top of energy and Arctic issues, as well as the importance of a hassle-free border, given it does not share a border with any other U.S. state.\n\n"I don''t know any representative from Alaska...that doesn''t understand just the devastation and the problem that could impact our relationship with the United States as the border issue will. And so they understand that very, very well and they''re impacted by it negatively more so than other states might be.\n\n"Sarah Palin, there''s no question that she''ll understand Canada and the importance of the relationship with Canada very, very well. From a Canadian perspective, there''s no discomfort whatsoever with having her vice-president."\n\nMr. Grafstein, who met Ms. Palin two years ago at a dinner in which she invited him to her table, echoed those sentiments and also believed Canada will be well served by Ms. Palin as well as Mr. Biden.\n\nScotty Greenwood, executive director of the Washington-based Canadian American Business Council, said: "Sarah Palin and Joe Biden, neither one is better or worse for Canada."\n\nHowever, she downplayed the influence of either candidate on their respective administration.\n\n"Policy is driven by the president," she said.\n\n<i>lee@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', '', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 3, 'biden_palin-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0),(6054, '<b> Parties Mum on Courting Expat Votes </b>  \n', '', 'It was likely a crowd pleaser. \n\nThe speech was delivered to the largest Canadian expatriate group in town, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, by one of the Conservatives'' consummate campaigners: Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Canadian Identity Jason Kenney.\n\nIt was October 2007 and Mr. Kenney, the Conservatives'' point man on courting ethnic voters, was on a three-day visit to Hong Kong. Since taking office in January 2006, Mr. Kenney had attended more than 500 ethnic community events in Canada in an effort to lock up support from an electoral segment that has long eluded the Conservatives.\n\nBut this overseas speech was different by targeting Canadian voters abroad.\n\nDuring his keynote address to the influential expatriate group, Mr. Kenney spoke to the great contributions of Chinese-Canadians to Canada, the entrepreneurial spirit of Hongkongers, and ended with the touching personal story of a Hong Kong-born Second World War veteran who became the first Chinese Canadian MP.\n\nIf it had been a campaign speech, it would have been a good place to deliver one. The small island hugging the coast of China is home to an estimated 250,000 Canadian citizens, among the most concentrated groups of overseas voters.\n\nIn previous conversations with <i>Embassy</i>, Mr. Kenney''s senior staffers were frank about the political elements of the trip, and the opportunity to tap into a large expatriate voter community.\n\nHowever, in an interview last week, Mr. Kenney downplayed the campaigning aspect of the taxpayer-funded visit, saying it was done "on a non-partisan basis."\n\nWhile Mr. Kenney was coy about his visit to Hong Kong, the trend of campaigning to expatriate voters has taken off in recent years across Western democracies, with campaign offices and overseas campaigns reaching unprecedented levels.\n\nMr. Kenney''s trip aside, this trend has not yet fully reached Canada''s shores. And with fewer than 10,000 votes cast from abroad in the last election, the federal parties are hedging their bets and campaigning at home.\n\n\n<b>Other Countries Leading Way</b>\n\nAs the American presidential campaign kicks into high gear, and with the recent elections being decided by razor-thin margins, Republicans and Democrats alike are aggressively campaigning to American voters living overseas.\n\nIn Toronto alone some 50,000 American votes are up for grabs, and with another six million worldwide, international campaign groups like Republicans Abroad and Democrats Abroad are trying to increase their global reach.\n\nIn the last French presidential election, candidates Nicolas Sarkozy, S&eacute;gol&egrave;ne Royal and Fran&ccedil;ois Bayrou all opened campaign offices in Montreal to battle for the 33,000 registered French voters in that city. Mr. Sarkozy, the ultimate winner, even launched Youtube videos specifically aimed at expatriate voters.\n\nBut in Canada, in the last federal election, only 9,208 special ballots were cast from abroad, an increase from the around 7,700 cast in the general elections of 2000 and 2004.\n\nAccording to Elections Canada, Canadians are eligible to vote by special ballot from overseas for only the first five years they are living outside the country. Exceptions are given, however, to Canadians employed with the armed forces, the diplomatic service and those employed by certain international organizations.\n\n<i>Embassy</i> asked the various Canadian political parties about their plans to court overseas voters in the now-imminent campaign. None have plans to set up offices overseas, and each revealed little about how they plan to nab expat votes.\n\nKarl B&eacute;langer, senior press secretary to NDP Leader Jack Layton, said his party will reach out to Canadian voters overseas primarily through the cost-effective and now ubiquitous medium of the Internet. \n\nHowever, he said his party is keeping its eye mostly on the domestic ball.\n\n"Obviously voters here, who are more likely to follow the day-to-day action, are a bigger priority," Mr. B&eacute;langer said.\n\nThe Liberal Party''s senior director for organization and outreach, James Anderson, would say little about his party''s international outreach efforts, refusing to give details because he feared other parties would copy his party''s strategies.\n\nMr. Anderson did write in an email, however, that "we do have an outreach strategy for attracting ex-pat votes and that we are confident that the majority of Canadians living abroad will support the Liberal Party of Canada."\n\nConservative Party spokesman Ryan Sparrow divulged even less. \n\n"We have specific ways of [campaigning to expatriate voters], but we won''t release how we campaign with them," he said. \n\nWhile party spokespeople said the secrecy was rooted in fear of divulging strategy, professor of Canadian politics at the University of Toronto Nelson Wiseman said there is likely little to divulge.\n\n"They don''t want to give away what they''re doing? I''m saying there isn''t anything to give away," he said. "They haven''t even thought about the overseas vote."\n\nWith so few voters overseas casting ballots, Mr. Wiseman said, courting expatriate voters is simply not worth the effort and expense for Canadian parties.\n\nMr. Wiseman said that with just 9,200 votes cast from overseas in the last election, there are "not at all" enough voters overseas to tempt parties.\n\nIt''s a small number to begin with, he said, and when divided by Canada''s 308 federal ridings, expat voters are little more than a drop in the ocean.\n\n"The bottom line, I would say, is that these votes do not have an impact in terms of individual constituencies," Mr. Wiseman said. "The numbers are just too small. It''s just not a big factor in elections."\n\nParties, he added, know that few expatriates vote and campaign accordingly.\n\n"The parties realize there isn''t much to be gained," he said. "It''s just a waste of energy."\n\nWhile Canadians can be found in all corners of the world, he said, many of these choose not to vote.\n\nThis, he said, is particularly the case for those who spent only as much time in Canada as it takes to gain citizenship before returning to their country of \norigin.\n\n"They''re Canadians, they''re entitled to Canadian benefits one of which is voting, but they''re not interested in voting," he said. "These people didn''t come to Canada to get a passport so they can vote in Canadian elections."\n\nHe added that many Canadians living abroad may not even be aware an election is underway, as Canadian campaigns garner sparse, if any, coverage in foreign mass media.\n\n<i>jdavis@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n', 'Jason Kenney delivered a stump-like speech in Hong Kong in October, but otherwise there have been few signs of what parties are doing.\n', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 4, 'expat_votes-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0),(6055, '<b> Guergis''s Georgia Trip Misses Disputed Areas, Sparks Criticism</b>  \n', 'Nearly three weeks to the day after Georgia initiated a violent and polarizing conflict with Russia, Canada''s government sent Secretary of State Helena Guergis to the region as a show of support to Russia''s nervous neighbours.', 'Nearly three weeks to the day after Georgia initiated a violent and polarizing conflict with Russia, Canada''s government sent Secretary of State Helena Guergis to the region as a show of support to Russia''s nervous neighbours.\n\nThe five-day trip, which started Friday, included stops in the Georgian cities of Tbilisi and Gori as well as the capitals of Ukraine and Poland, Kiev and Warsaw. \n\nBut even as the conflict in Georgia continues to make headlines around the world, attracting G7 condemnation, European Union statements and a visit by U.S. vice-president Dick Cheney, opposition critics are questioning the government''s response, including why Foreign Minister David Emerson wasn''t the one turning up in the region. \n\nMeanwhile, Russian Ambassador Georgiy Mamedov last week criticized Ms. Guergis for not using her visit as an opportunity to also visit South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\nBy Tuesday, Ms. Guergis had met with a handful of high-level officials in Tbilisi, including Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, Georgian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Grigol Vashadze, head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe mission Terhi Hakala, and head of the International Red Cross delegation Dominique Liengme. She also hosted a luncheon with UN resident and humanitarian co-ordinator Robert Watkins.\n\nMs. Guergis also visited an internally displaced persons camp in Gori and met with Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Ekaterine Zghuladze and Speaker of Parliament David Bakradze. The final leg of the trip took Ms. Guergis to Poland and Ukraine. \n\nMs. Guergis was not available for an interview in the days leading up to her trip, but in a statement Friday, she re-iterated Canada''s support for Georgia''s sovereignty, pledged $3 million in humanitarian assistance, and urged Russia to adhere to the six-point peace plan laid out by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in the days immediately following the start of the conflict. \n\nIn a press conference this weekend with Georgia''s deputy foreign affairs minister, Ms. Guergis said Canada is prepared to work with international partners "to achieve lasting peace and stability," and pledged continued support for Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO.\n\nBut at a reception at the Russian Embassy last week, Russia''s ambassador, Mr. Mamedov, stood by his government''s actions and repeated previous statements that he believed the Canadian position on the Georgia conflict was being driven by misinformation being fed by the U.S.\n\nHe openly questioned why Ms. Guergis was not visiting South Ossetia and Abkhazia. By doing so, he said, Ms. Guergis could witness for herself both sides of the story, rather than simply follow the assertions made by Europe and the U.S.\n\n\n<b>Emerson with Family</b>\n\nWhen asked why Canada''s foreign affairs minister wasn''t  involved in the trip, Mr. Emerson''s press secretary, Lynn Meahan, said it was an issue of timing.\n\n"The minister wasn''t available this weekend and Secretary of State Guergis was more than willing to visit the countries," Ms. Meahan said on Friday, saying only that Mr. Emerson couldn''t because he had a prior engagement.\n\nAnother staff member reported the minister was spending time with family over the Labour Day long weekend.\n\nThe minister''s absence was widely noted and criticized by opposition party members who felt it reflected the government''s approach to foreign policy. \n\nMs. Meahan said the trip was planned very quickly, probably a few days before being officially announced on Friday, and it was meant to show Canada''s commitment to Georgia.\n\n"Other countries have done the same, it just shows our solidarity," Ms. Meahan said. The visits to Kiev and Warsaw were "regular, diplomatic visits" she added, because Ms. Guergis was in the area.\n\nWithin hours of the crisis breaking on Aug. 8, a statement from Mr. Emerson condemned the violence and said Canada was ready to work with the United Nations and the Organization for Security Co-operation in Europe. Two days later, in another statement, Mr. Emerson called on Russia to respect Georgia''s borders and joined international calls for a ceasefire.  \n\nOn Aug. 19, following a hastily-arranged meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, a teleconference with Mr. Emerson was cancelled and instead, Canada''s ambassador to NATO, Robert McRae, took the line.\n\n \n\n<b>''Foreign Policy on the Run''</b>\n\nLiberal Defence critic Bryon Wilfert called the trip, and the government''s handling of the Georgia conflict, an example of the Conservative''s "foreign policy on the run," with no real road map, and said Canada should have taken a more aggressive response through multilateral channels, and that someone should have been over there sooner.\n\n"For a diplomatic mission, you have to have clear objectives spelled out, what outcome are you looking for, what tools are you using to get there?" Mr. Wilfert said. "I don''t know what the value is...I believe it''s essential to do these things, but if the game plan isn''t there and if you''re three weeks after, it''s not very helpful."\n\nInsistent that Canada could take on a leading role in the ongoing crisis, NDP Foreign Affairs critic Paul Dewar said sending Ms. Guergis instead of Mr. Emerson shows a lack of seriousness on the part of the Conservatives and questioned what Canada would gain from Ms. Guergis'' trip.\n\n"This is more of the same from the Conservatives in terms of foreign affairs, they should be sending someone at a senior level," Mr. Dewar said. "It''s really quite unfortunate because I have stated since this conflict ensued that Canada can play a very dynamic role here. I don''t think it''s helpful to push only the NATO message...and setting up that kind of Cold War narrative."\n\nMr. Dewar said Canada should have acted immediately by sending an envoy familiar with the region to report back with recommendations for the United Nations to consider. \n\n "There''s an opportunity missed here and I think Canada is in a perfect position to provide some leadership to turn the temperature down&mdash;on the one hand, point out the concerns that the world community has with Russia, but on the other hand acknowledge there are ethnic tensions within Georgia and in the Caucuses in general."\n\nWhile somewhat disappointed that Canada wasn''t sending Mr. Emerson on the trip, Queen''s University political studies professor Charles Pentland said that Ms. Guergis voicing Canada''s support for the NATO memberships at this time, particularly for Ukraine, is extremely important. \n\nOf all international players, however, Mr. Pentland said few observers are likely to be watching Canada too closely, and while sending the foreign minister would have sent a stronger message, a more junior minister can still convey the substance of the message.\n\n"Frankly, no one''s really going to be watching what Canada does in this, apart from the Ukrainians here in Canada and perhaps some Ukrainians over there," Mr. Pentland said. "As important as Georgia is for symbolic reasons and, of course, concerns about the pipeline, the stakes are much higher in Ukraine, frankly.\n\n"I assume she''s going to take a very strong position on safeguarding Ukraine''s independence, if anything our position would be even stronger on this than it would on Georgia."\n\n<i>mcollins@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n\n', '', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 1, 'georgia_trip-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0);INSERT INTO `story` (`story_id`, `story_title`, `story_brief`, `story_content`, `story_kicker`, `story_cutline`, `story_section_id`, `story_section_heading_id`, `story_super_section_id`, `story_front_page`, `story_order`, `story_url_id`, `story_issue_date`, `story_status`, `story_updated`, `story_lock_current_issue`, `story_lock_archives`, `story_hit_view`, `story_hit_email`, `story_hit_blog`) VALUES (6056, '<b> Democracy Support Policy Likely to Be Lost with Fall Election</b>  \n', '', 'As election fever heats up, there are growing fears an overdue whole-of-government policy on supporting democracies around the world will be left in the dust as another good idea that never got off the ground.\n\nLast summer, the Commons'' foreign affairs committee released a study recommending a number of ways in which the government can, and should, make Canada a leader when it comes to bolstering democracy in developing countries. Among the most controversial proposals was that Canada start working with political parties abroad, something the country has long shied away from.\n\nMonths later, in November, the government tabled a response in which it appeared to wholeheartedly embrace the committee''s suggestions, and even took them farther.\n\n"Evidence shows that many countries are sliding back to non-democratic forms of government," the government response stated. "While progress is being made in some countries, in others democracy is up against very significant obstacles and its fragility is increasingly apparent.\n\nThe government promised a number of actions, including the establishment of a so-called Democratic Transitions Fund at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the expansion of the existing Democracy Council, a forum in which Foreign Affairs and CIDA officials meet with representatives from arms-length organizations like Elections Canada, Rights &amp; Democracy and the Parliamentary Centre to discuss best practices and issues related to democracy development.\n\nHowever, the root of the government''s response lay in a promise to release a whole-of-government democracy support policy by May that would seek to "strengthen democratic processes...with a focus on elections, parliamentarians, independent media, political parties and civil society."\n\nLike its long-anticipated aid policy, however, the government has gone all but silent on the issue.\n\nSince taking office, the government has stated that its foreign policy decisions are driven by four principles: freedom, rule of law, human rights and democracy.\n\nAs a result, it appeared that strengthening democracy and governance in developing countries, which had long been a foreign policy objective for Canada, was ready to be taken to new heights. It even set up a new Office of Democratic Governance at CIDA. \n\nDavid Donovan, former research director at the Centre for the Study of Democracy at Queen''s University, which has been pressing the government on the importance of developing a concerted democracy support policy since 2004, said he had heard the issue had support within the Conservative Party, as well as the bureaucracy.\n\nHis understanding was Peter MacKay was providing leadership on the idea when he was foreign affairs minister but "with the ministerial shift [in August 2007], there was a drop off."\n\n"The agenda got lost," Mr. Donovan added. "It''s unclear as to who is controlling the agenda."\n\nThe only word Mr. Donovan has heard is that the government, led by the Department of Foreign Affairs, was undertaking a whole-of-government review of democratic assistance, which was supposed to have been finished a number of months ago.\n\n"As far as I know, the review is ongoing," he said. \n\nVarious government officials did not respond to requests for an update last week.\n\n\n<b>Election Dangers</b>\n\nWith an election likely to be called within the next few days, the sense is that unless it gets on a party''s election platform, the entire issue of democratic assistance is going to be put on the back burner for quite a while.\n\nThis fact has created a sense of urgency within the Parliamentary Centre of Canada, which has been eagerly awaiting word on where the government is going on the issue.\n\n"It can have a huge impact, especially for an organization like the Parliamentary Centre," centre co-ordinator Sonja Vojnovic said last week.\n\nMs. Vojnovic said there has been some movement on the plan to expand the Demo-cracy Council, of which the Parliamentary Centre is a member, but little else.\n\n"We are going through a consultation process, but it''s not a formal expansion yet nor have we announced an official expansion yet," she said. "There are movings, that aspect is moving. But as far as anything else is concerned, as far as we know, no, nothing official from government."\n\nTo that end, the centre is hoping to hold a number of events this fall to commemorate its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary while at the same time trying to keep the issue''s profile up.\n\n"We are looking to re-engage this dialogue to make sure it doesn''t get lost," Ms. Vojnovic said, though she was under no illusions democratic governance and assistance will figure on any party''s platform in the event of an election.\n\nLiberal MP Bryon Wilfert, who was serving as his party''s associate foreign affairs critic before becoming defence critic, was part of the foreign affairs committee''s study on democratic governance.\n\nLooking at the missing aid policy and the recent decision to scrap a $2.9-billion joint-support ship project, Mr. Wilfert said the fact the government appeared to wholeheartedly embrace the committee''s report and promised a policy, only to come up empty, is becoming a trend for the party. \n\n"Government is about priorities," he said. "If your priority is X, then that''s fine. But don''t try to suggest it''s something else as well, then not doing it.\n\n"It raises expectations in the general public, certainly among NGOs, certainly among interested parties.... Then to have this, then it''s hypocritical for the government to say they have any interest or care about it, because they don''t care about it. And if they don''t care about it, that''s fine. But let''s be honest."\n\nMr. Wilfert said the issue of democracy development is still of critical importance, and it''s unfortunate the government, which has repeatedly said democracy is one of the cornerstones of its foreign policy, isn''t following through with action.\n\n"Supporting freedom and democracy should be a top priority of this government, that''s what they claim, but let''s see the proof in the deliverables," he said. "Maybe the government doesn''t understand the importance of this."\n\nThe Liberal Party, he said, maintains two main tenets to its foreign policy, he added, security of the individual and human rights, and the development of democracy. As a result, he expected the party will have some sort of policy on the issue, either as part of its foreign policy, or a stand-alone strategy.\n\n<i>lee@embassymag.ca</i>\n\n\n\n\n', 'The government''s plan to develop a whole-of-government statement by May has seemingly disappeared.\n', NULL, 1, NULL, 0, 2, NULL, 'fall_election-9-3-2008', 1220414400, 1, NULL, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),(6057, '<b> Arctic Policy Panned </b>  \n', 'Prime Minister Stephen Harper is at it again, up there.', 'Prime Minister Stephen Harper is at it again, up there.\n\nFor the fourth time in three years, Mr. Harper has marched to the northern territories&mdash;with television cameras closely in tow&mdash;to declare Canada''s sovereignty in the region, his commitment to tapping its promising natural resources, and pledging federal dollars to do it all.\n\nBut even as Mr. Harper attempts to map his name across the Arctic on the brink of an election, critics are questioning the government''s overall approach.\n\nNDP Western Arctic MP Dennis Bevington said the government''s depiction of the North as a land with abundant resources is misleading because most of these resources are among the most difficult in the world to access. \n\nAt the same time, he criticized the government for having started off its northern vision with a military-heavy agenda.\n\n"I think sometimes the Harper government''s emphasis on militarization is a way of beating the drum, more of a public relations thing," Mr. Bevington said.\n\nHe said the Tories are only now starting to change their tune, as evidenced by the new requirement that all foreign vessels entering Canada''s northern waters register with Canadian authorities.\n\nBut at the same time, much more attention is needed now to resolve Canada''s two outstanding disputes with the United States over the Northwest Passage and the boundary line of the Beaufort Sea, he said. \n\n"We''re not going to settle those disputes by militarizing the Arctic," Mr. Bevington said.\n\nIn a paper published for the Canadian International Council, Franklyn Griffiths, the George Ignatieff chair emeritus of peace and conflict studies, warns that Canada is ill-prepared to face the Arctic''s potential.\n\nMr. Griffiths criticizes the Conservative''s decision in 2006 to eliminate the position of circumpolar ambassador and suggests Foreign Affairs re-invest efforts in its framework Nor-thern Dimension of Canada''s Foreign Policy.\n\nAs part of this, Mr. Griffiths, and indeed many others, urge co-operation with other "ice states" and indigenous peoples in shaping its policies.\n\nMeeting with the prime minister in the Arctic last week, Mary Simon, president of national Inuit organization Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, warned against focusing solely on "mega projects" and tagging the north as a "treasure chest" and "energy superpower."  \n\n"Social and economic development must go hand in hand, many Inuit live in material deprivation and face highly stressful situations of community and family distress," Ms. Simon told <i>Embassy</i>.

There was a last-minute frenzy as party activists, lobbyists, political junkies and the plain curious pulled out every stop to get the coveted credential that allows access to Denver''s Pepsi Centerâ€”the downtown arena that is also the home of the Colorado Avalanche hockey team.\r\n\r\nAlways a hot commodity, the task of procuring a convention credential took on almost mythical dimensions in the past few weeks as Obama campaign officials started to pull rank on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) staff and Host Committee organizers on the ground in Denver. The presumptive nominee always demands the ability to shape the convention program, but the transition to candidate control was delayed this year as Obama clinched the nomination late in the cycle.\r\n\r\nElected delegates and the infamous superdelegates are automatically credentialed, but the majority of those that seek access to the convention are neither of the above. Fundraisers, campaign workers, lobbyists seeking to make and maintain political connections, congressional staff, celebrities and political hangers-on try to use connections to get a seat in the arena.\r\n\r\nThe Obama campaignâ€”determined to showcase the grassroots face of their nationwide political machineâ€”broke tradition and hoarded credentials for their campaign volunteers rather than distributing passes through the connected Washingtonians who usually preside over the process. This caused a minicrisis in the capital as the traditional credential brokers were stymied and lobbyists had to pull out all the stops to beg, borrow or steal to get access to the big show for favoured clients.\r\n\r\nEven Invesco field, the football stadium where Barack Obama will mimic John F. Kennedy''s historic 1960 nominating convention appearance by making a massive outdoor speech, is not an easy ticket. Passes are being distributed through the Internet to Obama workers who can prove that they have logged the requisite hours as campaign volunteers.\r\n\r\nAmerican political junkies weren''t the only people clamouring for access to the Denver extravaganza. Hundreds of foreigners also jockeyed for observer status, hoping to experience the flash and hype of an historic American political convention. In addition to soaking in the scene, they want to glean insight into what makes Obama and his advisors tick and perhaps score a brief tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with a key Democrat.\r\n\r\nSince 1984, DNC officials have asked the National Democratic Institute (NDI)â€”a Washington-based non-governmental organization that supports democracy programs abroadâ€”to host a forum at the convention. NDI, which has a loose affiliation with the Democratic Party, organizes a week of nonpartisan seminars, receptions and access to the convention floor, which it calls the International Leaders'' Forum or ILF. In addition to 100 ambassadors to the U.S., NDI invites another 450 political party leaders, ministers, speakers of parliament, former heads of state and other political dignitaries to its program.\r\n\r\nCanadians are well represented in the NDI guest list, with attendees including government ministers Lawrence Cannon, Tony Clement and Peter Van Loan, Liberal Foreign Affairs critic Bob Rae, Senator Jerry Grafstein, Liberal Party president Doug Ferguson, NDP Leader Jack Layton and his party president, Anne McGrath, MP Rob Merrifield, and former party leaders Joe Clark, Kim Campbell, and Audrey McLaughlin.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian consul-general in Denver, former Regina Leader-Post columnist Dale Eisler, hosted a convention-week reception that included the Canadian political contingent, the Canadian media covering the convention, a selection of American politicians, Denver-area contacts and visiting dignitaries from Europe and Afghanistan. In all, 130 guests joined Canadian Ambassador Michael Wilson at Eisler''s official residence about 15 minutes from the convention site.\r\n\r\nWhile in Denver, the Canadian group will attend panels and events featuring Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright, Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former vice-president Walter Mondale and former senator and now Obama advisor Tom Daschle, among others. They will also hear from Obama foreign policy advisors; Greg Craig, Tony Lake, Susan Rice and Richard Danzig and will rub elbows with actor Ben Affleck, CNN founder Ted Turner, and former NBC Anchor Tom Brokaw.\r\n\r\nTwo topics seem to be pre-occupying the Canadians in Denverâ€”what would an Obama-Biden White House mean for Canada, and how does Obama raise so much money from small donors?\r\n\r\nCanadian parties, faced with strict donation limits, hope to dissect Obama fundraising strategies to see if any techniques can be transferred to Canada.\r\n\r\nThe choice of Senator Joe Biden as running mate caused a positive stir among the foreign convention observers. While it has become a truism that Obama enjoys runaway popularity with foreigners, the reality is a bit more nuanced. Many governments in the Middle East and Asia have become comfortable with George Bush and the Republicans, and some foreign leaders would be happy with a McCain presidency. With Cold War embers still smouldering, several European politicians attending the convention have suggested that they too are more comfortable with the tested McCain rather than the unknown Obama, although they are attracted to the younger man''s star power.\r\n\r\nBiden, already familiar to many foreign leaders, represents a steady hand on the world stage, but Obama had domestic considerations in mind when he decided to capitalize on the veteran senator''s foreign policy credentials. Obama''s need to show the American public a strong face in foreign affairs may have reassured foreigners as well.\r\n\r\nWhile Canadians may welcome the foreign policy leanings of an Obama-Biden partnership, the addition of the populist, Pennsylvania-born Biden to the Democratic ticket is sure to strengthen Obama''s desire to revisit NAFTAâ€”a policy with implications across the spectrum of Canadian domestic politics.\r\n\r\n<i>Leslie Campbell is a senior associate at the Washington-based National Democratic Institute.
